Becoming sick with COVID-19 virus or any other serious       respiratory condition is not fun. However, the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on       human society stem from its significant mortality, not the number of individuals who become       sick. This project aims to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization, respiratory       failure and death during the time it takes to develop vaccinations and other strategies to       prevent COVID-19 infectionPoor outcomes with COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization,       respiratory failure, organ failure and death are associated with a dysfunctional exaggerated       immune response, called a cytokine storm, that is triggered by Interleukin-6 expression       (IL-6) and seems to occur around day 5 to 7 of symptoms. Fluoxetine has extraordinarily       strong evidence in its action as a blocker of IL-6 and cytokine storms in both animal models       of infection and in human illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and others. This action of       fluoxetine is an entirely separate pathway than the serotonergic pathway that allows       fluoxetine to act as an antidepressant. This pathway has been demonstrated in cell culture,       in animal models, in human illness and by novel bioinformatics analyses of protein       transcripts to be relatively unique for fluoxetine and appears to be a novel pathway. This       project aims to inhibit the increase in IL-6 expression and thereby prevent the cytokine       storm that causes poor outcomes. Patients who have tested positive or are presumptively       positive for COVID-19 will be entered into the study and given the option to start the       medication fluoxetine, which is demonstrated to prevent IL-6 surges in infectious and       inflammatory conditions. Participants will be monitored daily for COVID-19 symptoms and       weekly for side effects and tolerance of fluoxetine. A subset of patients will have blood       drawn weekly and stored to monitor IL-6 and other cytokine levels at a later date.

While COVID-19 patients have       an increased need for supportive care, there is currently no specific treatment directed       against 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide inhalation has been used as a pulmonary vasodilator and has       been found to have antiviral activity against other coronavirus strains.       Preliminary data support a microbicidal effect of high concentration inhaled NO. We       hypothesize that high concentration inhaled NO can have a viricidal effect against SARS-Cov-2       and prevent the deterioration to a severe form of COVID-19 when administered at an early       stage of the disease. Additional potential mechanisms why INO may be effective in this       indication: 1)improves V/Q ratio, 2) reduces PVR and PAP, 3) Anti-thrombotic in lung. This       would have potential benefit for the patients in terms of reducing the severity of the       clinical course and time to recovery. An additional benefit could be for the society since a       faster and a less severe clinical course could protect limited hospital resources (ED, floor,       and ICU) from being overwhelmed.       The primary aim is to prevent the deterioration of mild COVID-19 infection (defined by a       RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen from any site) with respiratory signs/ symptoms       to a more severe form of the disease as defined by the patient needing to 1) return to the       ED, 2) be admitting to the hospital, 3) be intubated, 4) and all cause 28 day mortality.

This new kind of coronavirus is generating an unprecedented impact both on the       general population and on the healthcare systems in most countries. Health services are       trying to expand their capacity to respond to the pandemic, taking actions such as increasing       the number of beds; acquiring necessary equipment to provide intensive therapy (ventilators),       and calling retired health professionals and health students so they can assist the       overwhelmed health care workforce. Unfortunately, these organizational changes at health       facilities, along with the fears and concerns of becoming ill with the virus or infecting       their families, put an enormous emotional burden on workers in health services which may lead       to negative outcomes on mental health in this population. Based on the literature to date,       Covid-19 is significantly larger than previous pandemics in terms of the number of affected       people worldwide, its spread across countries, its impact on healthcare systems and the       severity of measures that have been taken by governments. Immediate consequences are palpable       in the health care system. Many healthcare workers are overwhelmed by the increased workload;       the lack of supplies and materials to provide appropriate treatment; the lack of clinical       guidelines on prioritization and triage; and the increased feelings of isolation and       loneliness. Previous research indicates that these negative effects can last over time and       lead to the development of serious mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress       disorder.       Recent cross-sectional studies in China indicate that health service workers exposed to       people with Covid-19 reported higher rates of depressive and anxious symptoms. This negative       impact on mental health among health workers in China has also been informally reported in       other countries where the Covid-19 pandemic has been devastating in its effects (such as       Spain and Italy), as well as in countries where the pandemic is becoming a growing public       health problem. This is particularly relevant in regions with fewer resources (Latin America,       North Africa), where there are limited means and the response from the health system is       usually insufficient. Moreover, it is necessary to study these negative effects       longitudinally considering that some effects will appear over time (post-traumatic stress).       Also, it is necessary to take into account the nature and the extent of the health response       (e.g., deployment, increased workload) in order to advance our understanding of these complex       phenomenon and to inform policy and develop the kind of supports that this population deems       useful.       Accordingly, this prospective (0, 3, 6 and 12 months), multisite cohort study aims to       describe, examine, and evaluate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health and       psycho/social factors among workers at health services from Latin America and the Caribbean       (Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Bolivia, and Puerto Rico),       Europe and neighboring countries (Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Armenia, Poland,       Macedonia, and Turkey), the Middle East and North Africa (Lebanon and Tunisia), as well as       Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Ghana) and Asia (China).

Diagnosing infection, defining recovery and       immunity has been challenging. Health care providers in particular are very interested in       knowing their status as they are highly exposed, and if infectious, can potentially transmit       infection nosocomially (in the healthcare workplace setting) and to their household. In       addition to understanding their exposure risk, infectious period, and immunity status, health       care workers are reporting high levels of psychosocial distress including anxiety and       burnout. The investigators aim to assess the baseline and cumulative seroprevalence of       SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers using both quantitative and qualitative serological       assays; describe psychosocial well-being and coping strategies among health workers in their       institutional settings and describe how knowledge of one''s serostatus affect psychosocial       well-being, and coping strategies.

Patients with hypertension, diabetes,       coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction       commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the       mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that       might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.       Fortunately, there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) which       suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19. TXA is a       synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor       sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used       to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding       (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other       indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama       at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At UAB, it is commonly       employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use       in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery,       orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological       disorders with a long track record of safety.       Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform       a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment       of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of       the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before       primary endpoints.       An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which       study patients have just been admitted to the regular hospital (non-Intensive Care Unit; ICU)       for the diagnosis of COVID19 is proposed. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to       assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population.       All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary endpoint for the study would be a       need for transfer to an ICU. Contact would be daily and via remote processes.

CHM includes over 400 medicinal substances and CHM formulas are individualized at       each visit according to the patient''s presentation. CHM has been used to treat cough,       shortness of breath, and fatigue and mechanisms of action have been investigated for SARS and       H1N1 influenza prevention and treatment by anti-inflammatory effects and antiviral activity.       Yet, there is a gap in our understanding of the clinical application of CHM in a community       sample of individuals experiencing symptoms that may be related to COVID-19. The       investigators have no pragmatic clinic data about the use of CHM for coronaviruses.       Safe and effective treatment of symptoms associated with COVID-19 is a top international       priority and research is needed to better understand if CHM is a safe intervention to treat       symptoms. Further, dissemination of trustworthy CHM treatment approaches for this complex and       emergent condition is needed within the CHM and scientific communities.       Aim 1: Conduct quantitative analyses of the collected data and disseminate findings to CHM       clinicians and to the scientific community.       Case series will be reported bi-weekly to CHM clinicians via the SIEAM website including       exposure, comorbidities, symptom change, concurrent medications, CHM prescriptions, adverse       events and usability. Data will be analyzed at the study conclusion for presentation to the       scientific community.       Aim 2: Conduct qualitative analyses of the collected data and disseminate findings to CHM       clinicians and to the scientific community.       Chart notes reflecting clinicians'' clinical reasoning will be content analyzed and posted       bi-weekly on the SIEAM website.

The Pandemic       Research Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch study leverages technology, clinical       research, epidemiology, telemedicine, and population health management capabilities to       understand how to safely COVID-19. The target population is individuals in the Duke Health       region as well as individuals beyond the Duke Health region who have flu-like symptoms, a       viral test order for COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, or concern for exposure to COVID-19. A       subgroup of particular interest within the target population is health care workers (HCW) and       families of HCW. Community members will enroll in the study electronically and for 28 days       will be reminded via email or SMS to submit signs and symptoms related to COVID-19.       Participants who report symptoms will be provided information about COVID-19 testing (if       needed) and established mechanisms to seek care within Duke Health. Instructions for       telemedicine and in-person visits, which is available publicly at       https://www.dukehealth.org/covid-19-update, will be presented to participants. Participants       who are unable to report symptoms independently may be contacted via telephone by Population       Health Management Office (PHMO) or Clinical Events Classification (CEC) team members. Data       collected through the Pandemic Response Network (PRN): Duke Community Health Watch study       will be used for three objectives.         -  First, to characterize the epidemiological features of COVID-19. Specifically, we will            have a high-risk subgroup of HCW and families of HCW that we enroll.         -  Second, to develop models that predict deterioration and the need for inpatient care,            intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.         -  Third, to develop forecast models to estimate the volume of inpatient and outpatient            resources needed to manage a COVID-19 population.       The primary risk to study participants is loss of protected health information. To address       this concern, all data will be stored in Duke''s REDCap instance and the Duke Protected       Analytics Compute Environment (PACE).

CT-V       and PBM images provide surrogates for pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, respectively, in       the form of detailed functional maps. CT-V and PBM therefore allow us to distinguish healthy       from abnormal lung. Moreover, the technique generalizes to recover lung compliance imaging       (LCI) when the CT is acquired at different pressure settings, in order to characterize lung       stiffness. PBM and CT-V can detect parenchymal lung function changes at a voxel level and can       be used to 1) assess disease progression in SARS-CoV-2, 2) detect treatment effects, and 3)       identify early changes in high-risk patients prior to their development of disease. BQLFI       affords the opportunity to provide imaging biomarkers that enable the early diagnosis of lung       injury, which in turn cause impairment in gas exchange at the level of alveolar capillary       interface. Currently, there are no available imaging biomarkers to predict patients at risk       of progression or identify those at risk of developing severe disease with SARS-CoV-2. Our       proposed study will validate a novel methodology, based on state-of-the-art CT-V and PBM       imaging that can accurately measure regional ventilation and perfusion, as a means for       improving surveillance, diagnosis, and prognostication of patients with SARS-CoV-2. This is a       prospective, pilot study of 25 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2, who have mild to moderate       disease, defined as positive PCR screen and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilator       support or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula. Participants will provide       informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. Demographics and medical history will be       obtained. Participants will undergo one inspiration-expiration CT. Outcomes and adverse       events will be assessed over 30 day using chart review or phone interview.     ","       The goal of this study is to evaluate if CT (Computerized Tomography) can effectively and       accurately predict disease progression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory       syndrome coronavirus 2). You may be eligible if you have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, are       an inpatient at Beaumont Hospital-Royal Oak and meet eligibility criteria. After consent and       determination of eligibility, enrolled patients will have a CT scanning session. After the CT       scan, patients are followed for 30 days by reviewing their medical records and by phone after       discharge from hospital.

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the       respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports       have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild       disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation       (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).       A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural       course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous       Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be       effective for ARDS of viral origin.       A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial involving 167 patients with ARDS       who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo       showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day       mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this       was a secondary outcome.       This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life       from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial       completion.       The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000       mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care       at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C       group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved       that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic       levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of       multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.       Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50       mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and       even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day       administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in       the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.       To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100       mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus       ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial researchers will explore three       following hypotheses:       Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary       Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.       Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days       (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.       Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days       up to 28 days.     ",       This study will test to see if a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg       every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 will reduce the lung injury       caused by the SARS-Cov-2.     ,Documented days free off mechanical ventilation the first 28 days post enrollment,Number of ventilator-free days,"Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center; Richmond; Virginia; 23249; Brian Davis, MD; brian.davis1@vcuhealth.org|Virginia Commonwealth University; Richmond; Virginia; 23298","Markos G Kashiouris, MD MPH; 804-305-7187; mkashiouris@vcu.edu"

The most current       statistics from Iceland, China, and Italy indicate that up to 50% of infected patients may be       asymptomatic or with negligible symptomatology. This, added to the national shortage of       personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to reuse PPE, lends to the significantly       increased risk to healthcare providers.       The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx. The virus is       thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation       of droplets, contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials, and airborne       transmission. Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including       intubation, bronchoscopy, proning patients (which can lead to droplet production) and in some       cases are reusing PPE, finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount.       Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi,       and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well       as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and rotavirus with good       efficacy.       Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure,       it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eggers et       al found that at a concentration of 1% there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99% in       in-vitro assays. At 2 minutes, a concentration of 0.23% was enough to reduce viral loads       appreciably.       PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little       to no effect on mucociliary clearance, olfaction, or thyroid function if iodine holidays are       taken.       In this study, front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation       survey and screened for COVID positivity. They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and       nasal sprays, as well as a calendar card to mark compliance. PVP-I nasal spray and gargle       (10% diluted 1:30) will be used prior to the start of a shift, during lunch break, and at       the end of shift. First, the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose (2 sprays each naris).       For adequate coverage, the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the       back of the throat. This should be left in place for 30 seconds. Then, the participant will       gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30       minutes. Treatment will continue for 3 weeks, or until the healthcare worker presents with       COVID symptoms. Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a       second questionnaire assessing study tolerability. At completion of the study, they will be       asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to       complete.       Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, a second arm will also be planned for patients       who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure.       These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same       questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent. For patients in the study       group, PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission       and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group. The patients will then be retested       in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with       SARS-CoV-2.

This acts to physically redistribute blood to       uninjured or minimally injured lung that can still participate in taking up oxygen.       Unfortunately, not all centers are equipped or trained for this maneuver which has it''s own       inherent risks. The investigators are proposing that the effects of proning can be safely       mimicked by the V/Q vest by applying pressure through a non invasive externally fitted vest.       By 4 front and rear inflatable compartments, doctors can fine tune the redirection of blood       as occurs in proning. However the vest successfully avoids the need for expensive specialized       equipment, training and facilities. In addition, preliminary assessment of the technique       using sand bags to apply pressure, the investigators found that those patients who did not       respond to this maneuver also failed to respond to more costly therapies. The vest       potentially acts as a therapy in and of itself and as an indicator of what is optimal       treatment for the COVID-19 patient while saving hospital resources and economic burden.       The study procedures will take less than 4 hours to complete for each subject enrolled.       During this time, the subject will be sedated. The ventilation perfusion vest consists of two       parts for ease of placement. The vest has multiple chambers which will be inflated to       different pressures. The vest will be inflated for 1 hour at a specific pressure and the       pressure will then be increased for another hour for the purpose of the study. This will help       to evaluate which pressure is optimal for altering lung function and oxygen levels.     ","       The objective of this research is optimizing oxygenation in patients in the setting of acute       hypoxic respiratory failure in relation to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through       non-invasive manipulation as a complementary therapy to traditional advanced mechanical       ventilator support, or as a marker of responsivity to supportive therapies. The intent is to       determine if it is possible to physically improve the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen       by applying external pressure to the chest. It is hypothesized that the use of the vest for       this patient population will alter the blood flow through the lungs and thereby improve       oxygen levels in the body. Participants will wear the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) vest for 2       hours and study activities will last up to 4 hours.     ","Improvement in oxygenation will be assessed by a demonstrated >20% increase in arterial oxygen levels after 120 minutes of treatment with the V/Q Vest, with two different levels of pressure.

Additionally,       minimizing sonographer interaction with patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID 19       minimizes the risk of sonographers as vectors for transmission to other patients. Lastly,       since the Caption AI device will be dedicated to the COVID wards and COVID ICU and not       transported to other locations, use of the CAPTION AI device will help to limit viral       transmission via the surfaces of the ultrasound machine.

However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with COVID-19,       especially those with severe disease, remains uncertain and is currently an area of active       clinical interest. Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is generally recommended for acutely ill       hospitalized patients. However, given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID-19       illness, it is unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce the risk       of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and even       disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose       anticoagulation must be weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this approach. To       address this critical gap in knowledge in an area of clinical equipoise, the investigators       plan to conduct a cluster-randomized trial in patients admitted to intensive care units       (ICUs) in a large volume academic medical center to select the best anticoagulation       intervention.

Although the morbidity and mortality for this disease       is low for young healthy individuals, it presents a potentially serious threat to older       healthcare providers or those providers with chronic medical conditions. Once a patient       arrives emergently to the emergency department (ED) setting, ED providers must act promptly       to evaluate these individuals for COVID-19 infection risk factors such as exposure, symptoms,       and chronic medical conditions. However, some medical and surgical patients presenting       emergently for evaluation are unable to provide a reliable medical history due to age, drugs,       the absence of a next of kin, or altered mental status. Acutely traumatized patients often       undergo computed tomography of the chest during their comprehensive evaluation. Adding a       rapid bedside ultrasound of the chest as a research procedure could allow validation of       ultrasound to help stratify medical and surgical patients into high and low risk of COVID-19       categories, with no radiation exposure, and far faster than current COVID-19 diagnostic PCR       testing.       Aims: In this project, we will collect data that will inform a novel strategy to mitigate       risk to providers by providing early, objective, and rapidly collected end organ data which       will permit the stratification of pediatric trauma patients into low or high risk COVID-19       categories. We will collect and evaluate lung ultrasound (US) findings in an expanded Focused       Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) evaluation of the chest of pediatric trauma       patients. The term FAST+ is used to denote the use of FAST expanded to image the select       lung fields in traumatized patients. We hypothesize that FAST+ will result in identification       of pulmonary findings indicative of COVID-19 infections and will significantly correlate with       the gold standard derived from computed tomography (CT) performed in parallel in these       traumatically injured patients.     ","       The current COVID-19 pandemic is providing healthcare organizations with considerable       challenges and opportunities for rapid cycle improvement efforts, in diagnostic and patient       management arenas. Healthcare providers are tasked with limiting the use of personal       protective equipment while minimizing unnecessary exposures to the virus. Results from       real-time PCR tests to detect active COVID-19 infections may not be available in a timely       fashion during emergent trauma assessments. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a       rapidly expanding body of literature has identified a pattern of imaged lung abnormalities       with CT and ultrasound (US) characteristic of an active viral infection. US evaluation       provides a reliable, portable, and reproducible way of evaluating acute patients in a real       time setting. During initial trauma evaluations, patients may also receive adjunct imaging       modalities like the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam designed to       discover life threatening findings that may require urgent interventions. We therefore       propose a study expanding on the current FAST adjunct evaluation in the trauma bay that may       include lung parenchyma imaging at the initial assessment to help stratify patients into low       or high-risk groups for active COVID-19 infections. We believe the use of point of care US in       the initial assessment of the trauma patient may help identify potentially infected       individuals and aid ED providers to best directing subsequent laboratory and imaging       evaluations for these patients, while further directing the necessary protective measures for       additional team members involved in the care of the injured patient.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with       COVID-19 develops a cytokine storm syndrome that is associated with elevation of       pro-inflammatory cytokines.       Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other       cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1       adrenergic receptor (⍺1-AR) signaling. The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin prevents cytokine storm       and markedly increased survival following inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In a       retrospective study of outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia, patients       who were taking ⍺1-AR antagonists had significantly lower probability of needing invasive       mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to non-users.       Prazosin may blunt surges in catecholamines and self-amplifying cytokine production       (including interleukin 6) and, as an early preemptive therapy in patients prior to disease       progression, may prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications of COVID-19.       In this study, patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing who are hospitalized (but are not       requiring more than 4 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula) will be screened       for eligibility.

Over the following       months, it quickly spread across the continent and, in short order, the globe, making an       impact that hasn''t been seen in generations. Although coronaviruses have been prevalent for       millennia, this version is immunologically novel, and thus there is no natural immunity to       the virus. This has been a major reason for its rapid spread across the world.       Previous members of the coronavirus family have typically caused upper respiratory symptoms       such as the common cold, though there have also been more virulent versions of this virus       seen in the recent past, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle       East Respiratory Syndrome). Similarly named, SARS-CoV-2 also causes upper respiratory       symptoms but has varied from the previous viral syndromes in a number of ways including how       quickly it has been able to transmit within a population. This is a disease that does not       segregate and can affect all ages, genders, and ethnicities. Everyone is susceptible to this       virus.       New diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respiratory viruses are also being rapidly       developed and polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) diagnostics and multiplex assays are       increasingly used in clinical laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 clinical detection and subtyping.       Rapid antigenic and genetic evolution has been expected for SARS-CoV-2 strains, and a better       understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics is needed to establish an effective       vaccine.       Our present understanding of the nature and extent of the upper respiratory track (URT)       microbiome in humans is limited. Furthermore, we have little understanding of how acute viral       respiratory infections of SARS-CoV-2 influence the URT microbiome, or how genotypic       differences in the virus influence the URT microbiome and vice versa. Innate immune responses       to pathogens, along with dysregulation of inflammation, are key factors involved in       pathogenesis, and different viral pathogens activate different types of inflammatory       responses. Respiratory viral infection i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to activate       TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 responses and this is likely to modulate commensal microbiota       populations. It is not yet known if the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease in older adults is due       to a biased host response, SARS-CoV-2 virulence determinants, or the impact infection has on       commensal microbiota.       Up to this point, there is no unanimously approved treatment for the disease nor is there a       vaccine or antiviral drugs available for the public. The primary methods for treatment of       this deadly virus have been supportive in nature including intubation in severe cases with       respiratory failure.       While a unanimous treatment has yet to be discovered, there has been a great amount of       knowledge garnered over the last few months about the virus and the disease that accompanies       it. Several studies have demonstrated high viral titers within the nasopharynx and oral       cavity and many have posited that this is the primary source of infection and viral       replication. Additionally, a high nasal/nasopharyngeal viral load has been associated with       increased symptoms and higher severity of the disease.       Interestingly, there have been a number of studies recently looking at the effect of nasal       saline irrigations in the setting of viral URIs, including coronaviruses (not including       SARS-CoV-2). One of the major takeaways from these studies was decreased viral shedding in       patients treated with saline irrigations compared to the control group. Nasal saline       irrigations are available over the counter and widely viewed as both safe and affordable.       Could these irrigations have a similar effect on the novel SARS-CoV-2 that they have on other       viral respiratory infections?     ","       Nasal saline irrigations are a safe and commonly used mechanism to treat a variety of       sinonasal diseases including sinusitis, rhinitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.       When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the       counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe       additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which       may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.       While many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not       yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx       where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the       counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs,       including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped       virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is       our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease       viral shedding/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal       inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.

Giving rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b may activate the immune system to       limit the replication and spread of the virus.     ,This refers to the frequency of grade 3 or 4 AEs considered to be probably or definitely related to the treatment regimen.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2       or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. The objective of this protocol is the identification       of eligible donors and collection of anti-SARSCoV-2 immune plasma from convalescent survivors       of COVID-19 illness.       Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and       their blood measured for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline       physical and laboratory examination. Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody       titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for       plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential       pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)       preparation for further study.     ","       Background:       The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In most cases, COVID-19 is a mild       to moderate respiratory illness. But it can also be more severe and even lead to death. There       is no vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also no therapy to treat COVID-19.       Researchers want to collect plasma from adults who have recovered from COVID-19, which may       help them develop treatments.       Objective:       To collect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune plasma from adult volunteers who have recovered from       COVID-19.       Eligibility:       Males and females ages 18 to 70 who have a history of COVID-19 like illness or positive test       for SARS-CoV-2, and have a minimum level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as specified by the study.

Their vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,       temperature, respiration rate) will be taken. Their weight and height will be recorded. They       will give a blood sample for clinical laboratory tests of their general health and a research       test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They will discuss their history of COVID-19-like illness and       any testing for SARS-CoV-2. They will be evaluated for their ability to donate plasma.       Individuals who are eligible and decide to join the study will have 1 to 20 plasma donations.       These will occur no less than 7 days apart.       Prior to each donation, participants will have a brief physical exam and complete a donor       history questionnaire. They will be asked about any current SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms.       At each donation, plasma will be taken through a standard apheresis procedure. For this,       blood will be withdrawn through a needle placed in the participant''s arm vein. A machine will       separate the plasma from the red cells. The red cells will be returned to the participant,       either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.

The study will describe the relationship between stressors       related to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a       range of participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The       utilization of a study website to consent and survey participants online is an efficient and       timely way to collect research data during this unique public health crisis.       Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the relationship between stressors related       to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of       participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. The secondary       objectives are to determine whether existing mental health concerns moderates this       relationship and to identify risk and resilience factors among study participants regarding       the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.       Endpoints: The primary endpoints are descriptive data on stressors experienced as a result of       the COVID-19 pandemic, and emotional, behavioral, and clinical symptoms. These endpoints will       be measured repeatedly using an online platform for up to 6 months. These repeated measures       will be combined with previously collected phenotype data on NIMH participants as allowed.

NCT04374565,2020-05-05,Recruiting,Phase 2,Interventional,Convalescent Plasma for Treatment of COVID-19 Patients With Pneumonia,Efficacy and Safety of High-Titer Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) Convalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Patients With Infection Due to COVID-19 to Decrease Complications: A Phase II Trial,Corona Virus Infection|Pneumonia|SARS-CoV 2|SARS Pneumonia,High-Titer Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) Convalescent Plasma,All,18,,No,22903,Treatment,N/A,Single Group Assignment,,None (Open Label),"       There are no proven treatments for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and associated pneumonia       caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent experience in       China suggests that convalescent immune plasma(CIP)may be an effective treatment for       COVID-19. In the pandemic situation where there are no vaccines for COVID-19, specific       antibodies in convalescent plasma induced by infection may provide passive protective       immunity. Passive antibody therapy was the first immunotherapy dating back to the 1890''s for       the treatment of infectious diseases before the development of antibiotics 1940''s. Experience       from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 shows that such       convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In SARS-CoV-2,       passive antibody therapy from CIP probably provided protection by viral neutralization. CIP       was also used in the 2013 Ebola epidemic. A small non-randomized study in Sierra Leone       revealed a significant increase in survival for who received CIP4. CIP administration is the       only approach that provides immediate immunity to patients who have been exposed or who have       active disease.       This approach is immediately available from individuals who have recovered, are viral       free,and can donate immune plasma (IP) containing high titer neutralizing antibodies. Passive       antibody therapy can be given to a patient recently exposed or a patient who is developing an       infection with COVID-19 by obtaining plasma units from immune individuals by standard       plasmapheresis using FDA-approved blood banking procedures, cross matching the unit(s) to the       recipients and infusing the unit(s) using standard transfusion procedures for blood products.       Based on the safety and long-term experience with plasma infusions, plasma exchanges, and       other procedures involving plasma or plasma product, this protocol was designed as a phase II       single arm trial that involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a       susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to       that agent.       The only antibody formulation that is available for emergent use is that found in       convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of       potential donors will increase.       The principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for       prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective       when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in       efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing       the initial inoculum, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease.       Alternatively, antibodies may dampen the early inflammatory response leaving the infected       individual asymptomatic. For example, antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most       effective when given shortly after the onset of symptoms and was of no benefit if antibody       therapy was delayed beyond the third day of disease. For passive antibody therapy to be       effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be infused. The antibody will circulate in       the blood, reach tissues,and provide protection against infection. Depending on the type of       antibody, amount, and composition, the half-life can vary from weeks to months. It is under       these circumstances, the investigators plan to treat patients who are sick enough to be       hospitalized before the onset of overwhelming disease involving a systemic inflammatory       response, sepsis, and/or ARDS.     ","       This is a single arm phase II trial to assess efficacy and confirm safety of infusions of       anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory       symptoms,with or without confirmed interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia by chest Xray or CT. A       total of 29 eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma.Outcomes       will be compared to hospitalized controls with confirmed COVID-19 disease through       retrospective chart review.

","       The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is spreading throughout the United States. While       there are no known therapies to treat those who have become sick, there have been some       reports that a medication currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and malaria       (Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, also known as Plaquenil) may help to lessen the chance or       severity of illness, especially if combined with a medicine that treats other kinds of       infections (Azithromycin, also known as Zithromax or Zmax or Zpak).       There are some people who test positive for the virus but who are otherwise not ill. Current       standard of care is to advise these people to self-monitor but no treatment is offered. It is       not known how many of these individuals will remain symptom free, and how many will become       sick or how severe those symptoms will be. This study will randomize those people who do not       have symptoms into one of three treatment plans 1) Hydroxycholoquine and Azithromycin, or 2)       no active medication (placebo).

Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases       called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including       Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues       described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170       and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle       replication and hence production. This observation was reproduced with MDL 28170, which       showed a >7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems. The anti-viral       activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a       small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively silence expression of this dimeric       calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement for dimeric m calpain activity       during SARS-CoV replication in vitro. MDL 28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor       compound with known off-target liabilities that has not been evaluated in nonclinical or       clinical safety studies.       It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is       angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are       co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant       early lung injury in COVID-19.       In addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical       animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels,       a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated       in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung       damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its       expression. Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral replication and the       nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity and mortality in       COVID-19.       BLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic       calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks       cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and       tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single       ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.       This study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in       hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.     ","       BLD-2660 is a novel, synthetic, orally active, small molecule inhibitor of calpain (CAPN) 1,       2, and 9 that is selective over the cathepsins as well as other protease families, displays       good metabolic stability and permeability, oral bioavailability and low cytochrome P450 (CYP)       inhibition. It is under development for the treatment of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)       resulting from infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2),       where there is significant unmet medical need.

The COVID-19 public       health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led       to several healthcare changes that affect physicians in training, including changes to       rotations and schedules, risks of infection exposure to themselves or their families, and the       unknown impacts this may have on their residency and fellowship experiences.       These changes are likely impacting their stress, health, and well-being. Physician burnout is       major concern for the medical community and likely to be further impacted by the current       pandemic. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy,       although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not       feasible for everyone during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including       antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects,       tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps)       may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation       is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in       which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2).       Calm is a mobile app that offers a range of meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time       stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds with modules that vary in length,       instruction, and content. Few studies on the use of Calm exist and include a randomized       controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a       descriptive study evaluating cancer patient''s perceptions of the app (1,3). There is evidence       to support the use of similar apps in resident physicians. A pilot study assessing the       effects of a meditation app on resident wellness suggested both the feasibility and efficacy       of such an intervention (4). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic,       mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in house staff       physicians, although this requires further investigation.     ","       Due to the COVID-19 global health pandemic, many people are likely experiencing increased       stress. The well-being of physicians in training may be significantly impacted by this       pandemic. Meditation is a self-management strategy that can be utilized by anyone to assist       with the management of stress. Meditation mobile applications, such as the Calm app, can be       used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time. The investigators propose       a prospective evaluation of perceived stress, anxiety, burnout and sleep disturbance in the       house staff at Banner University Medical Center Phoenix, with the use of the mobile       meditation app, Calm. The investigatros additionally want to evaluate the feasibility of       using the mobile app, including looking at adherence to use of the app and physician       satisfaction with use of the app.     ","Validated perceived stress scale survey, 10 questions in length rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often).

The first case of this unprecedented outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology       was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 8th, 2019 and reported to the       World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31st, 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global       emergency on January 30, 2020, and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11,       2020. As of April 22, 2020, more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and       182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China, according to the       data from Johns Hopkins University.       While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness,       approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5% of       those have multi-organ failure or shock. The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4% and it is       higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease,       diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer. The vast       majority of patients present with fever (83-99%), cough (59-82%), fatigue (44-70%), anorexia       (40-84%), shortness of breath (31-40%), sputum production (28-33%), myalgias (11-35%). Less       than 10% of patients will present with headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat,       hemoptysis, vomiting, or diarrhea. Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory       symptoms has been anecdotally reported.       To date, treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and       therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive, with prevention       aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon. No proven therapies have       been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a       critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study. Recently, the Infectious       Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with       COVID-19, focusing on inpatient care, and recommending randomized trials where possible as       the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this       coronavirus pandemic. Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment       for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness, as well.     ","       This is a multi-arm, phase II trial for rapid efficacy and toxicity assessment of multiple       therapies immediately after COVID19 positive testing in high-risk individuals. Therapies       include stand-alone or combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,       ivermectin, or camostat mesilate. The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of agents       that inhibit viral entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus, through alternative mechanisms       to hydroxychloroquine, will be devoid of additional moderate to severe toxicities, will       prevent clinical deterioration, and will improve viral clearance in high risk individuals.

Patients with hypertension, diabetes,       coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction       commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the       mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that       might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.       There is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, (TXA), which suppresses this       conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19.       TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine       receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is       normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy       menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use       for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the       University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At our       institution, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being       studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for       spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of       cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety. Given the potential       benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized,       double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases       of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as       hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.       An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which       study patients have just been diagnosed with COVID19 as an outpatient. The overall goal of       this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo       in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary       endpoint for the study would be a need for hospitalization. Contact would consist of daily       phone contact. Care for COVID19 would otherwise be standard of care.

Conventional medical therapy, including       intensive care and respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality. Aviptadil, a       synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan       Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and admitted to the FDA CoronaVirus Technology       Accelerator Program.       Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it       prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production,       protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in       numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and       dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar       interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.       Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of       safety in phase 2 trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction,       and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical       ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were       successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital and       one died of an unrelated cardiac event.       Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.       Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well       tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or       ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded       basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores       function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).       In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19       infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in       addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone.

The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic       originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has spread worldwide. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2       (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis and headache. Although the       majority (~80%) COVID19 cases are mild in severity, patients may present with moderate       symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea (~15%) or more severe symptoms (~5-10%) of pneumonia, acute       respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, arrythmias and shock(6-9). In addition to       the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, an increasing frequency of       cardiovascular manifestations have become evident. These manifestations may be linked to the       Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has       been identified as the functional receptor for SARS CoV-2, which is expressed predominantly       in the heart, intestine, kidney and pulmonary alveolar (type 2) cells. Recent data suggest       that ~20% of infected subjects may require hospitalization and among patients hospitalized       for COVID19, 12-28% will have evidence of myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity       Troponin: hsTPN) often in association with electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities,       arrythmias and/or evidence for impaired Left Ventricular contractile function on non-invasive       imaging. Indeed, a syndrome of pseudo-infarction manifest as ST-segment elevation in the       absence of obstructive coronary artery disease has been described. The etiology(s) of       myocardial injury may be multifactorial and includes demand ischemia due to critical illness,       cytokine storm with atherosclerotic plaque disruption due to overwhelming systemic       inflammation and more likely, myocarditis. Indeed, SARS CoV viral RNA along with macrophage       infiltration and myocardial cell injury has been detected in autopsied heart samples from       patients who succumbed to the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Further, myocardial injury has been       directly correlated with both the degree of systemic inflammation (Level of hsCRP) and       cardiac dysfunction (level of NT-proBNP). Importantly, myocardial injury was identified to be       one of the two most significant, independent predictors (by multi-variable analysis) of       hospital death (in addition to ARDS) and provides increased prognostic information above and       beyond that provided by pre-existing co-morbidities including age, diabetes mellitus,       hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the incremental risk for death       incurred by evidence of myocardial injury appears to be ~5-10x and is amplified by       pre-existing cardiovascular disease.       Thus, evidence of myocardial injury has evolved to be a significant (if not the most       significant) predictor of mortality among patients admitted to hospital for care of COVID19       disease. It is important to recognize that this elevated morality risk has been identified       despite modern and aggressive intensive care therapies including mechanical ventilation,       pressor/inotrope therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).       In this context, the investigators propose to evaluate intravenous administration of       convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring       hospitalization for symptomatic high risk COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of       elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of       COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness. The investigators hypothesize that treatment       with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with       the primary objective to reduce mortality and a key secondary objective to reduce the       requirement for and/or duration of mechanical ventilation. Finally, as the hospital mortality       for patients requiring mechanical ventilation is very high (50 to 80%), these patients will       be eligible for COVID19 CP treatment as well, even in the absence of elevated hsTPN. Although       considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement       for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP       may provide benefit to these critically ill patients.       This is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label treatment of eligible subjects defined as       those who satisfy all inclusion criteria.       Eligible subjects will provide written, informed consent prior to participation. A pregnancy       test will be obtained on all women of child-bearing potential.

","       The investigatores propose to evaluate intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP)       obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic high       risk COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist       for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral       illness. Investigators hypothesize that treatment with COVID19 CP will demonstrate salutary       effects on COVID19 disease severity/duration, with the primary objective to reduce mortality       and a key secondary objective to reduce the requirement for and/or duration of mechanical       ventilation. Finally, as the hospital mortality for patients requiring mechanical ventilation       is very high (50 to 80%), these patients will be eligible for COVID19 CP treatment as well,       even in the absence of elevated hsTPN. Although considerable overlap of these populations has       been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100%       redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill       patients.

The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19,       has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion.       The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and       limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of       frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these       individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient       care.       Of particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the       COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020).       Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and       loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt       et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been       described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006),       individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup       Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety       (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified       anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout.       Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a       key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007),       modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in       response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is       mediated by an increase in providers'' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical       first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic       and future crises for healthcare providers.

In children, recent evidence highlights acute and       long-term neurological manifestations due to other viral illnesses including Guillain Barre       syndrome and neonatal microcephaly with Zika virus, encephalitis with H1N1 influenza, and       acute flaccid paralysis with enterovirus-68. However, COVID-19 reports in children published       thus far lack detailed information on the frequency and outcomes of neurological findings.       COVID-19 cases are rapidly rising internationally, with experts forecasting subsequent global       surges and continued activity. Thus, it is imperative to accurately document prevalence and       outcomes of the neurological aspects of COVID-19 specifically in children. Such data will       serve to alert clinicians and families about the possibility that children may present with       neurologic rather than classic symptoms of COVID-19 who nevertheless would warrant testing,       and that neurologic events can occur subsequent to the diagnosis that may impact long-term       outcomes (e.g., cognitive, emotional, physical health).

We need to develop a treatment       protocol which prevents progression of the disease and a treatment protocol to rescue those       with advanced disease. In addition to anti-viral therapeutics currently under investigation       in other trials, the addition of immunomodulators to the treatment regimen appears have to       potential to act as agents which can reduce the pathogenicity of this disease by reducing the       dysregulation of autoimmunity which is destructive of normal tissue and when unchecked       rapidly leads to mortality.       COVID-19 infection has three stages and 80% of infected people stay in stage 1 or stage 2A       (viral response and early pulmonary effects), however 20% of patients progress to stage 2B       (late pulmonary effects), and of those about 20% progress to stage 3 (hyper-inflammation). An       ideal treatment for COVID-19 would have a two-pronged strategy: a treatment that would slow       or interrupt the progression of the disease from mild/moderate (stage 1-2A) to severe (stage       2B-3), and a treatment to rescue patients who have become severe. Promising data using       tocilizumab, an monoclonal antibody targeting the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6), suggests       that interrupting IL-6 is one of the potential pathways to accomplish this.       Low-dose naltrexone has been used off-label for treatment of pain and inflammation in       multiple sclerosis, Crohn''s disease, fibromyalgia and other pain conditions. Lower than       standard doses of naltrexone inhibit cellular proliferation of T- and B- cells and block       Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), providing pain relief and anti-inflammatory benefit. Naltrexone       at doses below the normal therapeutic dose appears to reduce production of multiple cytokines       including IL-6 in a steady pace and is available as an oral preparation. As such it is ideal       to use to attempt to modify progression to stage 2B as it can easily be given to both       hospitalized patients and patients in the community.       Ketamine at low doses, below the normal anesthetic dose, appears to rapidly reduce the       production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha       (TNFα), for hours after an event which would induce the inflammatory response. This drug is       given intravenously (IV), either by drip or push, and is easily given in a hospital       environment. This could not easily be used in the community but could act as a rescue drug       with lower cost and easier availability than tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting       IL-6. Ketamine has been extensively studied in a variety of settings and indications with a       well-established side-effect and dosing profile. Ketamine is generally well tolerated and       remains inexpensive and widely available on the U.S. market and available for immediate use.       The trial will measure the ability of low dose naltrexone to reduce the progression of       participants with COVID-19. In this study, naltrexone or placebo will be given to       participants in early stages of COVID-19 infection in a randomized, double blinded manner,       whereas the use of ketamine will be unblinded and given as a rescue agent should a       participant progress. Additionally, should a participant be ineligible for the randomized       portion of the study due to already being in a more advanced stage of the disease, they will       be given the opportunity to enter the trial to receive ketamine without being randomized to       naltrexone vs placebo.       Participants will continue to receive any standard of care COVID-19 treatment during their       participation in this study. Laboratory blood tests such as IL-6 concentration, blood counts,       liver and renal function panels as well as close physician supervision will be used to       monitor participant condition during hospitalization. Participants will be contacted 1 month       post discharge to evaluate outcomes and potential side effects.     ","       Ideal new treatments for Novel Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) would help halt the progression       disease in patients with mild disease prior to the need for artificial respiration       (ventilators), and also provide a rescue treatment for patients with severe disease, while       also being affordable and available in quantities sufficient to treat large numbers of       infected people. Low doses of Naltrexone, a drug approved for treating alcoholism and opiate       addiction, as well as Ketamine, a drug approved as an anesthetic, may be able to interrupt       the inflammation that causes the worst COVID-19 symptoms and prove an effective new       treatment. This study will investigate their effectiveness in a randomized, blinded trial       versus standard treatment plus placebo.

This trial is designed to       generate point prevalence of infected (I) persons, independent of clinical symptoms. The       susceptible (S) class is the number of COVID-19 tested by any FDA-approved NP swab test or a       SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody test. At present FDA does not have approved SARS-CoV serology and such       serology is not used for diagnosis of acute infection. The recovered (R) class is the number       of positives. This information allows for modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in NC. The       investigation is not testing the effectiveness or safety of either of these testing       modalities, though serology may be offered in the future by UNC Healthcare laboratories. The       blood samples to be obtained assess development of host response to SARS-CoV2 infection.       ScreenNC will be implemented within the logistic and clinical limitations of the current       outbreak. This is a single visit study. Since there is a shortage of PPE the investigators       will rely on screening at locations different then the screening of presumed infected       persons. Additionally, due to logistical considerations, volunteers may have a viral swab       (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal) and/or a blood sample obtained. Thus, at recruitment,       volunteers may be asked to give both samples or only one.

Moreover, with       increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical       ventilation, nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to       limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of       collapse, highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the       development of respiratory failure for these patients.       The disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period, an acute viral phase that most       commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe       hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic       respiratory failure.3,4 Though there is spectrum of clinical course, many progress to the       hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms, often requiring intensive care unit       (ICU) level care and mechanical ventilation.4 Accumulating evidence suggests that the       pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as       demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome       (CRS)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).3 CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome       on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), typically       characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the       setting of excessive immune activation, typically with marked hyperferritinemia.5 Postmortem       assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with       MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and       alveolar congestion, splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis, as       well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying       liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.6 Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH       overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of       IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP- 1, and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer, C-reactive       protein, LDH and troponins.5,7,8 Moreover, preliminary data from a non-randomized series of       COVID-19 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from China who were treated with       tocilizumab (in addition to standard therapies) showed they had dramatic improvement in       fever, arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours       following administration.9 Taken together, these data strongly suggest an immunologic link       between COVID-19 and immune dysregulation resulting in MAS. Clinical trials are already       underway studying the role of immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6       and downstream pathways in the setting of CAR-T induced MAS (NCT04150913, NCT04071366) and       agents such anakinra and tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results       and good safety profiles. There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for       immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at       an individual level and prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a       systems level, to which end there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these       efforts into the setting of COVID-19 infection (ChiCTR2000029765, NCT04324021, TOCOVID-19).       Based on the MGH experience thus far with COVID-19, including over 200 patients to date, the       need for mechanical ventilation has been approximately 30%. With the upcoming surge       anticipated between April 17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU       beds. We propose a trial of IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease       course to try to prevent progression of COVID-19.     ","       This is a randomized, double blind, multi-center study to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab       compared to placebo on patient outcomes in participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection       and evidence of systemic inflammation.       Participants will complete screening procedures, where inclusion and exclusion criteria will       be evaluated. After screening, participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the       exclusion criteria will be randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab or placebo. Participants will be       followed for safety for 28 days after the last dose of study drug.       We anticipate enrolling between 300 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (and       additional Partners sites, after approval, including BWH, NSMC, and the NWH) into the trial.

NCT04360954,2020-04-27,Recruiting,,Observational,Evaluation of Antibody Tests for COVID-19,Evaluation of Commerical Antibody Tests for COVID-19,Coronavirus|COVID,Diagnostic test,All,18,,,63110,,,,Case-Only,,"       Background       Molecular (RT-PCR) tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19. They       detect viral RNA and are a good marker for current infection and infectivity. However, these       tests are expensive and in short supply. In advanced COVID-19 cases, virus concentration in       the upper respiratory tract is often low, as the infection has spread to the lungs and viral       RNA is sometimes undetectable by RT-PCR using nasal swaps. Antibody tests detect human       antibodies to viral proteins in the blood or other body fluids. They could be useful for       diagnosing current infections (slightly less sensitive than RT-PCR tests), and they remain       positive after persons have recovered from the infection. Thus, antibody tests are expected       to be useful for diagnosis of current infections, for verifying recent infections in persons       who were not tested by RT-PCR when they were ill, and for documenting possible immunity to       the virus. Antibody tests may be especially valuable for use in low and middle income       countries that lack resources for widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.       Anticipated test sensitivity and specificity. Manufacturer data for several antibody tests       claim that more than 90% of persons with COVID-19 (clinical symptoms and positive molecular       tests) have positive antibody test results for IgM and/or IgG. They also claim specificity in       the range of 93-95% for samples from persons who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.       Availability of antibody tests. In recent months, many antibody tests have been developed and       marketed. The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND, closely linked to World Health       Organization (WHO) and supported by a large grant from the United Kingdom government) in       Geneva Switzerland reported that they had identified more than 70 such tests, and they       shortlisted 27 tests for further evaluation. Of these, only one test produced in the USA       (produced by Cellex) has received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US FDA, and       no test has formal FDA approval. Antibody tests use different diagnostic platforms, but most       tests use the SARS-CoV-2 S1protein, and a few tests also use the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Few       studies that independently evaluated the performance of these rapid antibody tests have been       published to date in peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, more data are needed to evaluate the       sensitivity, specificity, and value of these tests.       Methods       The Weil Lab research group at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) has extensive       experience developing and evaluating rapid format diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.       The group has special interest in infectious disease diagnostics that can be used in low and       middle income countries and is used to work under challenging conditions after disease       outbreaks. In this project, rapid-format antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be evaluated and       antibody test results will be compared with results of RT-PCR and metadata (age, gender,       clinical symptoms, time after exposure when known).       Patient samples. Deidentified serum or plasma samples will be tested from patients who have       been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19. Control samples from our serum bank       (deidentified samples from healthy humans and samples from persons with parasitic diseases)       will also be tested. The number of serum or plasma samples to be tested will be left open,       but this will depend in part on the number of samples available and the availability of test       kits. It is anticipated that approximately 500 samples will be tested initially, but more may       be tested if that is necessary to achieve study objectives. The tests and research are for       research only, and we will not report test results from individual patient samples to       clinicians to support patient care.       Note: No voluntary enrolment into this study will be conducted; all testing is to be       conducted anonymously.       Antibody test kits. Marketed commercial or prototype antibody detection kits will be obtained       by donation or purchase. Tests to be evaluated are to be determined, but this will depend on       availability and cost. The focus will be on rapid-format, point-of-care antibody test kits       that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant viral proteins. The goal is to test at       least five (5) different kits including at least two (2) that are manufactured in the USA.       Test procedures. Manufacturers'' package inserts or protocols for test performance will be       followed. These vary across different test platforms. Persons who perform the tests will not       know PCR results or other metadata associated with the human samples when they perform the       tests. Tests will be read by two independent readers and recorded. A third reader will be the       deciding vote for cases with discordant readings.       Test data. Antibody test results (IgM and IgG) for each different test kit will be entered       into a test result form with the participant''s unique identifier number (UI). Results will       later be merged into a database that contains the UI and metadata such as age, sex, fever,       cough, date sample was collected, date of symptom onset, exposure history (travel, household,       work). Acceptability of test performance will be judged according to a working target product       profile (TPP) appended at the end of this protocol.       Primary objective       1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of tests for antibody to SARS-CoV-2, the virus       that causes COVID-19 disease. Separate criteria will be used to define sensitivity for acute       and convalescent samples.         1. Sensitivity for diagnosis of acute cases will be defined as % positivity in samples from            symptomatic cases with positive RT-PCR results. .         2. Sensitivity for detecting antibody in convalescent samples expressed as % will be the            number of positive antibody tests divided by the number of samples tested from persons            with documented past infections (by RT-PCR) who are now at least 2 weeks past resolution            of symptoms and currently RT-PCR negative.         3. Sensitivity will also be defined as % agreement with results from a reference antibody            test as soon as one is identified.         4. Specificity will be defined as the % of negative control samples (collected prior to            1/1/2020) that have negative antibody test results.       Secondary Objectives         1. To determine relationships between the time after infection or onset of symptoms of            COVID-19 and the presence of antibodies to the virus as determined by antibody test            kits.         2. To determine the duration of antibody responses following infection.         3. To compare background reactivity (false positive rates) for sera from the USA vs. sera            from developing countries in areas where chronic parasitic infections and consumption of            bushmeat are common or where people live in close relationship with wildlife that may be            a reservoir for zoonotic viruses.         4. To assess test performance characteristics (ease of use).       Benefits to participants. None       Benefits to society. Antibody tests may be useful for diagnosis of infection and for       documentation of past infection. Independent test validation studies are critically       important. That is because test results from companies may be biased. In addition, companies       often do not report on the user friendliness of rapid diagnostics. Antibody tests may be       especially valuable for use in low and middle income countries that lack resources for       widespread molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.     ","       The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of several marketed       commercial or prototype test kits for antibody to SARS-CoV-2. The focus will be on       rapid-format, point-of-care antibody test kits that detect both IgM and IgG antibodies to       recombinant viral proteins.

This intervention will target the inpatient setting generally.       Scientific/Clinical Rationale for Approach Since emergence of the novel coronavirus, severe       acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) now designated coronavirus disease 2019       (COVID-19), one in six affected patients becomes seriously ill. The lung appears to be the       most susceptible target organ, with a large swath of symptomatic patients struggling with       mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia resulting in respiratory       failure. This respiratory failure is often fatal, with one study showing 28% non-survivors       having experienced respiratory failure. Moreover, 81-97% of patients requiring mechanical       ventilation do not survive.       Like its interaction with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), angiotensin       converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for COVID-19. Viral adherence to       host-cell membrane associated ACE2 facilitates the proximity required for viral spike       mediated genetic material injection. In COVID-19, this spike is 10-20 times more likely to       bind ACE2 than SARS. ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells, with 83% of those       cells being alveolar epithelial type II. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis       showed that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II have high levels of multiple       viral process-related genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life       cycle, viral assembly, and viral genome replication, suggesting that the ACE2-expressing       alveolar epithelial type II cells facilitate coronaviral replication in the lung. Thus, these       cells likely serve as a ready reservoir for viral invasion. Perhaps more importantly,       alveolar type II cells function to generate and recycle surfactant essential to respiratory       activity. Surfactant defends against alveolar collapse at low lung volume and protects the       lung from injuries/infections caused by inhaled particles and micro-organisms. In COVID-19,       if these vital cells are being destroyed, alveolar failure may ensue with severe lung       impairment. Thus, interventions that are aimed at improving pressure normalization and       alveolar protection may be beneficial in these patients.       Prone positioning (PP) has long been used to combat hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress       syndrome (ARDS). Improvements in gas exchange result from improved alveolar ventilation and       blood flow redistribution with enhanced perfusion following. PP reduces lung over inflation       and bolsters alveolar recruitment. PP also promotes uniformity of vertical pleural pressure       gradients resulting in more uniform alveolar size. Considering these physiologic factors       together, we hypothesize PP serves to balance stress and strain within the lungs of       non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 leading to improved outcomes compared to       traditional supine positioning.       Prior Research Supporting the Positioning Model:       Multiple studies have been conducted that support the use of PP as a proactive treatment to       combat hypoxemia in ARDS. Each year, approximately 170,000 people are diagnosed with ARDS,       and those diagnosed face mortality rates between 25% and 40%. The use of PP stretches back to       the 1970s, as providers began to search for ways to ameliorate ARDS symptomatology and reduce       the then even higher levels of mortality associated with it. Following initial reports that       PP significantly improved oxygenation in 70-80% of patients with ARDS, it was adopted as a       standard treatment option. Initially, randomized clinical trials struggled to replicate these       findings, citing multiple limitations to study enrollment and treatment standardization that       made ascertaining conclusive results difficult. Only as RCT construction has been refined to       accommodate for these limitations have the benefits of PP been more clearly demonstrated.       These beneficial effects have been recently upheld by the landmark PROSEVA study, a       multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, that randomly assigned 466 patients       with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in       the supine position. Their results demonstrated a significant improvement in both 28- and       90-day mortality rates: the 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the       supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95%       confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone       group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29       to 0.67).       Per these positive findings, PP has been consistently shown to be an effective mechanism to       increase oxygenation in patients with ARDS when implemented under the following conditions:       early enlisting of treatment and its consistent maintenance for at least 16 hours per day,       and with concurrent use of lung-protective therapies. Translating these findings towards       treatment of COVID-19 positive patients seems promising given the similarity of manifested       symptoms and complications.     ","       This study aims to determine if provider-recommended guidance on supine (on back) vs. prone       (on stomach) positioning of patients testing positive for COVID-19 requiring supplemental       oxygen, but not yet mechanically ventilated, improves outcomes in the inpatient setting. This       study will be performed as a pragmatic clinical trial.

Participants will be recruited throughout the United States and its       territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands) with outcomes followed longitudinally       for twenty years.       Initial analysis will be descriptive and include computation of frequency distributions,       adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Multiple logistic regression methods will       be used to assess association of health symptoms or conditions with estimates of exposure to       COVID-19. Psychological distress will be estimated from self-reported responses to validated       psychological instruments and survey items created to capture the unique aspects of exposure       to COVID-19 in workplace settings. Odds rations will be adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity       and job classification. The logistic regression model(s) will include self-reported baseline       health status and other variables. Preliminary explorations of variable associations will be       performed to aid with the development of sub-studies from the registry.       No direct health benefits are anticipated for participating in the study, but participants       may learn about their health. Participation in the study provides the participants the       opportunity to express the impact of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic on their health,       which may be a source of relief.

This risk may be related in part to the patient s            immune response which can be characterized with respect to the B- and T-cell repertoire.            Determining patterns of immune response which correlate with clinically effective            immunity may help in determining risk.         -  Patients receiving a vaccine for COVID-19 are tested for antibody production, but            ultimately protection from infection and survival are the most important endpoints,            which will take time. If patients can be checked for a pre-defined favorable pattern of            immune response, it may significantly speed selection of effective candidate vaccines.         -  In patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with hairy cell leukemia            (HCL) who we have extensive experience treating, we do not know if we should be steering            away more from treatments which harm B-cell immunity, like rituximab or obinutuzumab, or            steering away more from treatments which harm T-cell immunity, like purine analogs.            Characterizing the immune response in COVID-19 patients will quickly answer this            question.       Objective:       - To characterize immune response in patients with current or prior COVID-19 infection       Eligibility:         -  Age 18 years or older         -  Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection, or normal donors (i.e., those            individuals without COVID-19)       Design:         -  Blood samples will be collected for research to characterize immune response.         -  In individuals with known current or prior COVID-19, samples will be obtained up to once            per week, at least once during the acute phase of infection and once soon after            recovery. In individuals without COVID-19 at the time of enrollment (i.e., ''normal''            donors), samples will be collected once; in the case of future COVID-19 infection,            samples may be collected at the same times during/post-infection as an individual with            COVID-19 at enrollment.         -  All subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years. An additional blood sample may            be collected in all subjects at one additional time after the receipt of future            COVID-19-related vaccination on or off study.         -  This protocol does not involve treatment. The accrual ceiling is set at 150 subjects     ","       Background:       People who get infected with COVID-19 have an unpredictable risk to worsen and die. This       makes it hard to decide who can quarantine at home and who should be treated at a hospital.       Researchers think the risk may be related to a person s B and T cells. B and T cells are the       major components of a person s immune response.       Objective:       To examine how immune cells respond to COVID-19 infection.       Eligibility:       Adults ages 18 and older who have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection or had COVID-19       in the past, as well as people who have not had COVID-19       Design:       Participants will be screened with medical record review.       Participants will give blood samples at NIH or at their local doctor s office or lab.       Participants who have or are suspected to have COVID-19 will give blood samples up to once a       week during the active infection. This may include while they are in the hospital. They will       also give a sample after the infection is over.       Participants who have recovered from a past COVID-19 infection will give a blood sample at       least once, and maybe up to once per week for a few weeks.       Participants who do not have a history of COVID-19 infection will give a blood sample once.       If they become infected in the future, they may be asked to give blood samples during       infection and after, as listed above.       Participants who get a vaccine for COVID-19 in the future may be asked to give an extra blood       sample.

Treatment arm       In addition to the local standard of care for COVID 19 patients, the patient will receive       colchicine PO as such:         -  Loading dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg after 2 hours if without significant            gastrointestinal symptoms (day 1)         -  The next day 0.6mg bid for 14 days or until discharge       Patients who are on HMG-Co A Reductase Inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin,       simvastatin), fibrates, genfibrozil, amiodarone, dronedarone or digoxin should have the       colchicine dosage reduced to a loading dose of 0.6mg followed by 0.3mg after two hours (day       1) followed by 0.3mg BID for 14 days or until discharge.       If patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after loading, the dosage may be       reduced to 0.3mg BID for the rest of the 14 day course or until discharge. If       gastrointestinal symptoms continue, the medication should then be discontinued. Patients who       experience sensory motor neuropathy, or symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with       rhabdomyolysis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug. If renal function       deteriorates during the treatment course and CrCl <30ml/min, colchicine should also be       discontinued.

Since the primary clinical endpoint is progression of disease, if the patient requires beyond       8L nasal cannula, eg. high flow O2 or mechanical ventilation, the primary clinical endpoint       is met and the above experimental medications will be permitted. To rephrase, the patient       will be allowed, Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors and other immunomodulators if then deemed       medically necessary by the treating physician.     ","       The most prevalent complication of COVID-19 infection is respiratory failure from severe       acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the leading cause of mortality. There is increasing       indication that the decompensation in severe COVD-19 infection may be due to a cytokine storm       syndrome. This hyperinflammatory syndrome results in a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia       and multiorgan failure.       Approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 infection are hospitalized and 20-30% of these       hospitalized patients require ICU care and/or mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality in       hospitalized patients is approximately 20-25%. There is significant interest in therapies       that can be given upstream to reduce the rate of mechanical ventilation and thus mortality.       We hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate-severe patients may       decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements,       mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

","       This phase II trial studies how well antiviral therapy works when given in combination with       baricitinib for the treatment of moderate or severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).       Antiviral therapy such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir may act       against infections caused by the virus responsible for COVID-19. Baricitinib may reduce lung       inflammation and help prevent the need for being placed on a ventilator should the disease       worsen. Giving antiviral therapy in combination with baricitinib may reduce the risk of the       disease from getting worse compared to antiviral therapy alone.

Surge of patients requiring hospital admission have led to shortages of ICU beds and       mechanical ventilators. As an emerging clinical entity, little is known about the precise       pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19. Recent observational data and clinical experience       has suggested that there could be different phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 which could       explain the wide range of clinical presentations, response to therapies and outcomes.       Point of care cardiac and lung ultrasound (CLUS) has been proposed as a tool with potential       to assist diagnostic evaluation and management of COVID-19 patients in the emergency       department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Point of care CLUS is routinely used       as part of the clinical evaluation of patients with dyspnea, hypoxemia, chest pain and shock       in the ED and ICU. Patients with COVID-19 commonly present to the ED with these symptoms and       therefore CLUS is being commonly used in patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of       COVID-19.       Small observational studies have described several lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in patients       with COVID-19. These findings include; pleural irregularity (thickening), subpleural       consolidations, air bronchogram, isolated B-lines, fused B-lines and pleural effusions. Other       observational studies have described the presence of acute myocardial abnormalities in       patients with COVID-19 seen in echocardiography, including left and right ventricular       systolic dysfunction.       Multiple studies have described and validated the finding of B-lines in LUS as a non-invasive       marker of extravascular lung water. B-lines in LUS correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge       pressures, NT-proBNP and E/e'' and has been validated as a reliable prognostic factor in       patients with decompensated heart failure. B-lines are also found in other pulmonary       processes including viral pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary contusions and post radiation changes.       Observational studies involving COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of isolated and       fused or continuous B-lines in the pneumonia associated with this infection. We hypothesize       that the presence of B-lines in LUS may be marker of severity, and that alone or in concert       with other clinical or laboratory variables, could help predict the clinical course and       prognosis of COVID-19 patients.       Knowledge gaps         1. Does point of care cardiopulmonary ultrasound findings alone, or combined with other            clinical and/or laboratory variables, predict clinical outcomes of patients with            COVID-19?         2. Can different lung ultrasound finding patterns correlate with clinical severity or            outcomes?       Specific aims         1. To characterize various clinical and CLUS findings and describe their relationship with            clinical course of patients with COVID-19 in ED and ICU.         2.

Duringthe early emergent phases of such diseases, there       is often no vaccine to prevent infection, nor specifictherapeutic agent to treat the disease.       The objective of this protocol is the collection of immune plasma from persons post-recovery       from COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This plasma may potentially be used in the       treatment or prophylaxis of active COVID-19 under other protocols.       Candidates will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and their       blood levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline physical       and laboratory examination. Subjects with sufficient neutralizing antibody titers who meet       standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for plasma       collections. Plasmapheresis is the preferred method of collection, with up to 800 mL of       plasma collected per donation depending on the weight of the donor. Collected immune plasma       will be tested for blood-borne pathogens, and stored according to standard blood bank       procedures. The scope of this protocol is limited to collection of plasma from subjects with       sufficiently high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer. Any administration of       convalescent immune plasma to subjects will be performed under a separate protocol.     ","       Background:       The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health issue. Right now,       there is no vaccine to keep people from getting sick. There is also no treatment for people       who do get sick. Researchers want to collect plasma from people who have recovered from       COVID-19. The plasma will have antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. If a       vaccine is made, people who develop immunity from the vaccine can also donate plasma.

Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated potent       inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin together have       significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage over 6 days compared to a placebo and       COVID-19 patients who received a 5 day regimen of 400mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine had       significantly shortened times to clinical recovery characterized by improved pneumonia       compared with patients who did not receive Hydroxychloroquine.       Within OSF Healthcare approximately 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are currently       receiving some form of Hydroxychloroquine during the course of their hospitalization. The       utilization of this treatment has been approved by the FDA based upon the limited data       available.       Significance:       The optimal treatment regimen for COVID-19 patients has yet to be defined. Several small       studies have indicated a potential role for the utilization of Hydroxychloroquine in the       treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, very little evidence exists around the       optimal treatment regimen and efficacy with regard to tangible outcomes. This observational       retrospective/prospective chart review study aims to help provide epidemiological data that       may help to provide guidance to clinicians for both future patients, as well as provide       clinicians guidance for study design of more definitive controlled studies. Given the rapid       spread of this disease, the high mortality rate associated with it and the impact of the       disease upon society this study is anticipated to have the potential to contribute       significantly to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.       Study Design and Methodology:       The study will be a retrospective/prospective observational study of cohorts of hospitalized       patients across the OSF Healthcare System who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit       signs or symptoms of respiratory distress during the course of their hospitalization. The       outcomes of patients who both receive and do not receive Hydroxychloroquine will be compared,       with particular attention to the timing of administration in relationship to the onset of       respiratory distress. Respiratory distress will be defined as a low SpO2, an elevated       respiratory rate or an increased oxygen demand. Hydroxychloroquine administration will be       defined as a documented administration of the medication on the patient''s medication       administration record (MAR). Administration of Hydroxychloroquine prior to the onset of       respiratory distress, administration of Hydroxychloroquine on the day of respiratory distress       and administration of Hydroxychloroquine following the onset of respiratory distress will all       be assessed and compared across three outcome metrics; progression to an ICU location of       care, progression to ventilator support and mortality.         -  Patients at all OSF HealthCare locations across the Ministry that meet            Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be cohorted by:              -  Hydroxychloroquine administered - yes (including the date started)              -  Hydroxychloroquine - no         -  For the Hydroxychloroquine administered - yes cohort, further subdivide into 3 cohorts:              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was before the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was the same as the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was after the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress         -  At this point the investigators would have 4 cohorts:              -  Hydroxychloroquine - No              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was before the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was the same as the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress              -  Hydroxychloroquine date started was after the date recorded for signs of                 respiratory distress         -  These 4 cohorts would be compared to determine any difference in the following metrics:              -  Mortality              -  ICU Admissions              -  Ventilator use         -  Additional study of additional treatment regimens using a similar design may be repeated            for the following treatments              -  Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin              -  Remdesivir (This is a compassionate use medication with very limited use in OSF.

Results of this study will be presented within OSF Healthcare at national meetings            and/or published in academic journals. The investigators will not disclose any subject            PHI or identifying personal information in any presentation or publication about the            study.         2. The study investigators will be responsible for data safety monitoring. This is an            observational study which only involves data collection from the hospital/institutional            sources (e.g., hospital notes, office visit notes,). This study does not dictate any            specific surgical treatments or medications. All procedures performed on the patients            are standard of care and the study does not involve any additional hospital visits for            subject or the parents/guardians. Data that will be collected from patient records will            be securely stored on password-protected computers accessible only by applicable            research personnel.       Data Analysis:       Data analysis will be performed by the PI and applicable research personnel.       Oversight and Ethics:       This study will be conducted in compliance with the Peoria IRB research policies and       procedures and all applicable laws and regulations. The staff members will perform the study       in accordance with the protocol, and will report unexpected problems in accordance with the       Peoria IRB policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations. Collection,       recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and       welfare of research subjects during and after the study.       Privacy and Confidentiality:       Study staff will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality permitted for clinical and       research information obtained from the participants. Medical and records will be maintained       in the strictest confidence. However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal       responsibilities of an investigation, the clinical site must permit monitoring       representatives of various governing facilities to examine clinical records for the purpose       of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluations of the registry safety and progress.       Unless required by the laws that permit copying of records, only the coded identity       associated with documents or with other participant data may be copied (and all personally       identifying information must be obscured). Authorized representatives as noted above are       bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that is       linked to individuals. The clinical site will normally be notified before auditing visits       occur.       Risks:       The main risk in this study is the potential breach of privacy and loss of confidentiality.       There is minimal risk of likelihood of harm. All reasonable safeguards to secure the       confidentiality of information will be taken by the investigators and their research       personnel.

Study population: High risk HCW with direct patient contacts, defined as physician       assistants, respiratory therapists, nurses, physicians or other HCWs working at emergency       rooms, ICUs and in locations within hospitals where COVID-infected patients are treated.       Intervention: Participants will be randomized between intradermal administration of BCG       vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.       Recruitment, Randomization, treatment allocation, and blinding       A standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A       research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an       IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further       instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own       electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to       a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed       recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research       personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the       trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of       baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).       Once the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap,       the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment       assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an       appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible       participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.       Both, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the       study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received,       the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will       provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the       end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.       Unblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other       than the baseline eligibility criteria.       The end of the study is defined as the last patient''s last entry in the electronic data       capture system.       Informed Consent and Eligibility       The following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:       Medical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent       will be obtained to access these records. When information cannot be obtained or is not       available from the patient medical record/clinical chart, it will be obtained via patient       interview. Physical examination will be conducted solely to look for existing BCG vaccination       scars.       Symptom evaluation will be conducted via an electronic survey administered to participants       every 1-3 days.       HIV and pregnancy will be collected as self-reported information. If unknown, a urine       pregnancy test will be performed.       Nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swabs will be collected for rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2       infection if a study develops symptoms consistent with Covid-19.       If a participant does not know their PPD/IGRA status from within the last 24 months (all       health care providers should have this information), an IGRA can be performed to evaluate       eligibility.       Study participants have the option of donating blood via phlebotomy (for serological test for       Covid-19 disease and PBMCs for immune correlates) or providing a fingerstick and dried blood       spot (for serologic test for Covid-19).       Data will be collected at four time points/periods: (1) after consent, (2) at baseline, (3)       during follow-up period, and (4) at study end.       Data to be collected during screening includes medical history, physical exam results,       results of rt-PCR and serological test results.       Data to be collected during baseline enrollment includes eligibility confirmation,       demographic information, risk factors, randomization assignment, confirmation of BCG       vaccination/placebo, any immediate reactions to BCG vaccination/placebo.

Note that this is part of routine surveillance for Covid-19 in health workers at       the United States site. Consent forms will ask for consent to access this survey information.       Any positive response on the survey will trigger a nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swab       to be collected to test for Covid-19 via rt-PCR       All participants, regardless of survey responses, will have serology for Covid-19 tested at 4       week intervals during the follow-up period (6 months)       If a participant completes the follow-up period and does not test positive for disease, their       study participation is complete       If a participant does test positive for disease, their disease status will be ascertained for       up to two months or until an outcome is available through one of the following mechanisms:       (1) an electronic survey if they are not admitted to the hospital, including questions about       the number of days they are ill, daily fever, and other symptoms; or (2) (2) if they are       admitted to the hospital, ordinal outcomes for disease severity will be extracted from the       hospital¿s electronic medical records system.       During the first week of follow-up, all participants will actively be asked about any adverse       events; thereafter, participants will report unsolicited AEs through the electronic survey.       Vaccine related adverse events will be graded using the FDA guidance       (https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download) and noted using WHO-recommended Adverse event       following Immunization forms (AEFI;       https://vaccine-safety-training.org/classification-of-aefis.html).       Participants will have the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma (serology) and PBMCs       for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future analysis based on covid19-specific       IgM and IgG. If they do not donate 12mL of blood, a fingerstick will be required for baseline       COVID19 serology.       Dried Blood Spot (DBS): all participants are HCWs and will self-collect DBS samples at week       4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Envelopes to store the DBS are provided upon enrollment and can be       dropped off at work and picked up by study coordinators to minimize HCW distractions.       COVID specific RNA is found in stool for ~21 days when an individual develops infection       (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). Participants will have the option of collecting       stool swabs monthly if they are asymptomatic or weekly if they develop symptoms. Nucleic acid       testing will be performed in retrospect to support secondary objectives.       If participants develop symptoms consistent with COVD19, will be PCR tested for COVID19. They       will be given the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs 2 weeks after       symptoms resolve.       Week 12 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for       plasma and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary       analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.       Week 24 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for       plasma and       PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on       covid-specific IgM and IgG.       Except for the administration of BCG vaccine or placebo and the above mentioned DBS and       phlebotomy, participants will undergo no invasive procedures for study purposes.

The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent       medical reasons. Participants who received placebo will be unblinded at the end of the study       and pending a recommendation by the DSMB, they will be offered the option of receiving the       BCG intervention.       A participant will only be replaced in case of withdrawal before the administration of BCG       vaccine/placebo.     ","       SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly throughout the world. A large epidemic would seriously challenge       the available hospital capacity, and this would be augmented by infection of healthcare       workers (HCW). Strategies to prevent infection and disease severity of HCW are, therefore,       desperately needed to safeguard continuous patient care. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a       vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other respiratory       tract infections in in vitro and in vivo studies, and reported morbidity and mortality       reductions as high as 70%. Furthermore, in our preliminary analysis, areas with existing BCG       vaccination programs appear to have lower incidence and mortality from COVID191. The       investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity       during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2.     ",The primary outcome measure is the development of COVID19 infection. We will use the Cox proportional-hazards model to calculate hazard ratios for the development of Covid-19. This will be reported as the proportion of individuals receiving the intervention who are PCR-positive or seroconvert. defined as number of new cases during the 6 month time period,Incidence of COVID 19 Infection,"Baylor College of Medicine; Houston; Texas; 77030; Andrew DiNardo, MD; Andrew.Dinardo@Bcm.Edu; 832-822-1038|Baylor St. Luke''s Medical Center; Houston; Texas; 77030; Seth Lerner, MD; slerner@bcm.edu; 713-798-5553|Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Los Angeles; California; 90048; Pablo Avalos, MD; Pablo.Avalos@cshs.org; 310-248-8571|Texas A&M Family Care Clinic; Bryan; Texas; 77802; Gabriel A Neal, MD; gneal@tamu.edu; 979-436-0431","Jeffrey D Cirillo, PhD; 979 436-0343; jdcirillo@tamu.edu"

Animal model studies of SARS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID19 symptom       severity may be due to protective and acute actions of the female sex hormone estrogen.       Animal and human studies support immune modulating effects of estrogen that are acute acting       in viral infections and wound repair processes that may reduce the damaging effects of the       virus on the lung and symptom severity.       Our hypothesis is that a short 7 day course of estradiol delivered in a transdermal patch       applied to the upper buttock in COVID19+ or presumptive positive patients will be safe and       will reduce symptom severity in adult men and older women when given prior to intubation.

The observational study protocol will       include the conduct of smartphone based research to capture an essential dataset to improve       our understanding of disease evolution, risk factors, and outcomes as well as enable       population-based monitoring to reduce the spread of disease. Under this protocol, sub-studies       and clinical trials can be conducted for interventions, including vaccine trials. The work       may include new tools such as surface environmental or personal swabs to test for presence or       absence of disease. Data collection efforts on behalf of rapidly evolving multiple study       designs and participant opt-in data sharing, will enable the compilation of critical       epidemiological and other data across the United States to accelerate the understanding for       effective mitigation and treatment of COVID-19.       ACCESS (American COVID-19 Collaborative Enabling Seamless Science), a novel COVID-19 digital       research infrastructure, provides a mobile app tool for participants to report specific data       and facilitate remote access to accelerate critical research and clinical treatment       development.       ACCESS leverages leading digital health technologies to facilitate at-home research, clinical       trials, and population-based long-term outcome studies and data de-identification measures       (data coding/tokenization). The infrastructure combines opt-in wearable sensors, patient       reported data and outcomes, opt-in data aggregation and additional opportunities for users to       participate in clinical trials and share their de-identified data based upon reported       information.       Prior to COVID-19, the FDA expressed an interest in expediting drug development through       developing trial designs that test multiple drugs and/or multiple subpopulations in parallel       under a single protocol, without a need to develop new protocols for every trial. This has       become even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of work will also be       enabled under the ACCESS system.     ","       ACCESS enables individuals to contribute to critical research, via an iOS and Android       smartphone mobile application. ACCESS combines patient reported outcomes, data from wearable       devices and real-world data (such as claims, EHRs, etc), with an opt-in to participate in       current and future studies for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. The data that people       share can be quickly and anonymously matched to research studies, providing researchers with       a foundational framework for dynamic research at scale and participants a way to be       personally matched and prescreened for future research.

This data is urgently needed to assist in care and promote       recovery of COVID-19 patients worldwide, and elderly patients who are at higher risk due to       increased age, pre-existing risk factors (frailty, sarcopenia, malnutrition), and co-morbid       conditions. Further, new pathologies such as COVID-19-related cardiac dysfunction must be       described and rapidly identified. Our innovative measurements will provide direct       non-invasive assessments of the effect of COVID-19 infection on key measures including energy       expenditure, substrate utilization, muscle mass, cardiac function, mitochondrial function,       and body composition. In addition, we will be able to provide objective data on key recovery       intervention requirements including energy/nutritional requirements, effects of nutrition and       rehabilitation efforts on muscle mass and energy state, and recovery of cardiac, muscle       function.       Study Questions: We propose to evaluate longitudinal metabolic and cardiac pathophysiology in       patients with COVID-19 to understand, guide and optimize our metabolic clinical care during       acute hospitalization. Further, this data will be essential in providing objective data to       guide physical recovery interventions including nutrition delivery and physical therapy to       ensure functional recovery of COVID-19 patients.       We hypothesize: 1) COVID-19 will lead to significant, EE/metabolic changes, systemic       mitochondrial dysfunction, significant muscle wasting and loss of function throughout the       course of illness and during recovery. We hypothesize metabolic needs will initially decrease       in acute illness and subsequently increase as patients transition from the acute phase of       COVID illness to recovery phases. This data will guide nutrition and metabolic/clinical care       in all phases of COVID-19 care where, for example, over-and under-feeding may pose risk to       patient outcome. We hypothesize loss of muscle mass and physical function occurring in       COVID-19 will significantly affect nutritional/rehabilitative/recovery of function/QoL needs       and requires addressing to personalize care to optimize clinical and functional recovery       efforts in older COVID-19 patients.       We believe longitudinal detailed indirect calorimetry with the innovative new Q-NRG device,       cardiac assessment, body composition, and muscle and ultrasound measures in COVID-19 patients       will play a key role in understanding and treating COVID-19 infection by providing objective       data on the metabolic, cardiac, volume/fluid status, and nutrition needs of COVID-19 patients       to the bedside clinician. This will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of       COVID-19 and the ability of clinical teams to optimize care and patient outcomes. These       urgently needed data will lead to key advances in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients       worldwide.     ","       This current proposal evaluates the Longitudinal Energy Expenditure and Metabolic Effects in       Patients with COVID-19 (LEEP-COVID) to understand, guide and optimize our metabolic and       nutritional care of these high risk patients. As no data exist for the metabolic effects of       COVID-19 patients, this data is urgently needed and essential to assist in the care of       COVID-19 patients worldwide. We are uniquely positioned at Duke to perform this research, as       we are the only US center with 2 of the FDA-approved devices in existence currently capable       of collecting this vital data to guide the care of COVID-19 patients worldwide.

A series of reports have       implicated that asymptomatic transmission occurs in at least 25% SARS-CoV-2 cases. We       hypothesize that droplet emission from oral fluids generated during speaking could be an       important and actionable factor driving asymptomatic transmission. We aim to collect oral and       nasal secretions to test for viral load and viral infectivity in 1) asymptomatic high-risk       subjects with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, but with a history of close personal contact with a       SARSCoV- 2 positive person and 2) asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic subjects who are       SARS-CoV-2 positive. COVID-19 positive individuals re-testing as negative can be enrolled to       complete the electronic questionnaire(s) assessment and allow for evaluation of history of       symptoms.     ","       Background:       COVID-19 is a worldwide pandemic and currently there is no effective therapy or vaccine.       SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory infection, appears to be very       contagious however all the modes of transmission are unclear. Transmission may occur in up to       25 percent of cases when there are no symptoms (asymptomatic). Before there are any symptoms,       droplet spray during speaking may increase transmission from person to person; most of the       spray is saliva. Researchers at the NIH would like to test saliva for the virus before       symptoms are reported. Additionally, they would like to examine the importance of using masks       to prevent transmission. They hope to better understand how COVID-19 is spread among people       and how it can be prevented.       Objectives:       To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is present in saliva in asymptomatic individuals who are       COVID-19 positive.       To determine if using masks can prevent transmission.       Eligibility:       People ages 18 and older without symptoms of COVID-19 who have been in close contact (e.g.       live in the same house) with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or NIH workers who       have tested positive for COVID-19 and have mild or no symptoms. Retested individuals may be       enrolled to understand how the disease has progressed and resolved.       Design and Procedures:       For screening, interested participants will contact a study team member. The interested       participant will be asked to provide documentation of COVID-19 positive status, their       symptoms, or their contact to a COVID-19 positive person.       Participants will have weekly telephone calls to discuss their symptoms and 2-5 drive-up       visits to the NIH within 28 days.       At the drive-up facility, participants will participate in a speaking exercise with and       without wearing a mask. The droplets they produce while they speak will be collected.       Participants will spit into a cup and have saliva collected from different areas of the       mouth. They should not eat 90 minutes before this but drinking water or juice is acceptable.       They may have their tongue painted with a sour liquid to increase their saliva. Participants       will have a swab rubbed inside their nose. For those who are close contacts and need a       COVID-19 test, they will have a swab inserted through the nose to rub the back of their       throat.       Participants will complete questionnaires about their symptoms electronically at home.

The plasma is donated by       an individual that has recovered from the very same infection that another person is infected       with. This plasma is enriched in the antibodies that recognize and helped the body''s immune       system fight off the infection. When transfused from donor to recipient those antibodies will       aid the recipient in fighting off the infection. In recent history this has been used to       fight Ebola. Recently, the Federal Food and Drug Agency (FDA) made possible expedited       Investigational New Drug (IND) process for plasma use in the fight against COVID19 for       emergency and lifesaving uses.       There are several other investigational drugs for treatment of COVID19 such as: Remdesivir,       an antiviral. The off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/ritonavir, or Tocilizumab       have been authorized. Convalescent plasma mechanism of action helps to promote health by       working with one''s own immune system and will not interfere with the other proposed       medications. It also will not weaken the immune system as the investigational and off label       medications have the potential to do. Convalescent plasma is time honored and although       investigational for each use against novel or rare infections, it is the basis for IgG       infusions in the immunodeficient populations. Currently the use of IgG infusions such as       Intravenous IgG (IVIG) is assumed to not have the right antibodies from donors in the general       public. This is secondary to the novel nature of the COVID19 and the fact that the IVIG       available today was collected 6 to 12 months ago from plasma donors; prior to the COVID19''s       outbreak discovery in China.       It is for that reason that IVIG is not recommended at this time and the FDA has made special       fast-tracking announcements for plasma use for COVID19. Currently, plasma is the only       treatment that has a previous history of success in these novel or rare viral outbreak       situations. It has already been reported to have been associated with survival of 5 out of 5       participants in a pilot study in China       For the purpose of this study advanced respiratory support will include any measure of       respiratory support above low flow nasal cannula oxygen (2 Liters/minute flow rate).       For the purpose of this study dyspnea will be defined as any shortness of breath that is not       completely relieved with the use of low flow nasal canula oxygen set to 2 Liters/minute flow       rate and/or requiring breathing treatments such as but not limited to: bronchodilators more       than every 4 hours to relieve symptoms.       In the event that more than one recipient is identified and plasma is available in less than       the total number of approved recipients, priority will be given to those approved by the FDA       for the IND use of plasma for severe or critical condition. If there still exists a deficit       of plasma, the priority will be given to those on advanced respiratory support with the most       critical settings (if unclear then will be considered a tie); active pressor treatments; age       <1 years of age with days of life, age adjusted for prematurity as a tie breaker; age >60       with years as a tie breaker; and lastly lottery pull with potential remaining recipients as       the final tie breaker.     ","       This is a prospective study, involving contacting potential plasma donors and the use of       their plasma to help fight off infections of those suffering from COVID19 in accordance to       collection guidelines for plasma and FDA IND requirement. This study will include up to 240       participants potentially receiving convalescent plasma and up to 1000 potential donors.       There are 3 basic arms to the study: mild, moderate and severe/critical severity. All 3       severity groups are eligible for enrollment, but mild severity will not be given plasma       unless there is progression. Moderate severity will given up to 1 unit of plasma and       severe/critical severity up to 2 units. There is no placebo group, however given the excepted       issues of shortages of plasma, intention to treat will be used for analysis.

COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with numerous prediction models       suggesting potential shortages in ventilators, ICU beds, and high rates of hospital       mortality. Case-series suggest sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are       driving hospitalizations, morbidity (ICU beds, ventilator use, organ failures), and       mortality. A therapy is urgently needed to be given early in the disease course in order to       attenuate the infectious and inflammatory process, reduce risk of intubation, and reduce       progression of organ failure and ARDS. By administering HDIVC at the first objective sign of       worsening oxygenation, documented by change in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2)       to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio (S/F) or decreased SpO2 at baseline (mild hypoxia       group), HDIVC may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respiratory failure       requiring intubation. We will also enroll patients already in respiratory failure on       ventilators (severe hypoxia group) and document safety and tolerability in both cohorts. By       calculating ventilator and ICU-free days, we can potentially signal clinically relevant       endpoints that could be used in larger trials needed to answer a crucial therapeutic       question—can early administration of HDIVC in COVID-19 lead to faster recovery or improve       outcomes? Moreover, we will document change in inflammatory markers that are elevated in       COVID-19 (d-dimer, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes, and ferritin) to develop a mechanistic       understanding and risk stratification of response to HDIVC infusion. Ultimately, if HDIVC is       deemed safe and tolerable in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects, a larger clinical trial will be       indicated. AVoCaDO will produce safety and tolerability data to test HDIVC in a multi-center,       rapid, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with COVID-19.     ","       Previous research has shown that high dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) may benefit patients       with sepsis, acute lung injury (ALI), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).       However, it is not known if early administration of HDIVC could prevent progression to ARDS.       We hypothesize that HDIVC is safe and tolerable in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)       subjects given early or late in the disease course and may reduce the risk of respiratory       failure requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS along with reductions in       supplemental oxygen demand and inflammatory markers.

Moreover, a       large proportion of these patients develop cardiovascular complications; many have markedly       elevated NT-proBNP levels, and a substantial proportion have evidence of acute myocardial       injury and/or acute kidney injury. SGLT2i have previously been demonstrated to have potent       heart and kidney-protective effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, heart failure and/or       chronic kidney disease, and may afford protection of these vital organ systems in the setting       of COVID-19.

Furthermore, both pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that SGLT2i may favorably impact       the underlying mechanistic processes dysregulated in the setting of acute major illness (such       as COVID-19) and include favorable effects on energy metabolism, autophagy, oxidative stress,       tissue hypoxia and inflammation (Ferrannini 2017, Aragón-Herrera 2019, Tanaka et al 2018,       Packer 2020, Esterline et al 2018).

Limited data are available from       small outpatient studies and have not shown efficacy in preventing hospitalization.       Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and immune-modulating effects, but       there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral load and shedding in       outpatients.       Evidence supporting possible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. In cell models, chloroquine       both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the cell surface receptor       by which SARS-CoV2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH, which interferes (at least       in vitro) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,2 HCQ is 5x more potent than chloroquine       in a Vero cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In independent experiments, chloroquine has       confirmed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, HCQ has in vitro efficacy       against SARS-CoV-1. According to news releases, an as-yet-unpublished set of case series in       China (N reportedly 120) suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates of       progression to critical illness. In addition to in vitro anti-viral effects chloroquine and       HCQ appear to have immune-modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF       and IL6, especially in macrophages.       Evidence against efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine and HCQ have been promoted as       extremely broad anti-infective agents for decades. The reported effects include suppression       of fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses. Other than the effects on ACE2 glycosylation, the       mechanisms invoked as evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have also been invoked for a       wide range of viruses. However, when chloroquine and HCQ have been studied in humans, neither       agent has demonstrated consistent efficacy in clinical trials, including in HIV, influenza,       hepatitis, and Dengue. In one trial, chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in       Chikungunya virus [Roques et al, Viruses 2018 May 17;10(5)] while in another       hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV viral load [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul       25;308(4):353]. Expert opinion advises against HCQ for MERS, another serious coronavirus. An       underpowered (n=30) study of HCQ in COVID-19 recently published in China did not demonstrate       any clinical benefit [Chen et al, J Zhejiang University, 2020 March 9]. The long history of       clinical failure despite in vitro anti-viral activity suggests a low probability of efficacy.       Rationale for Trial There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in       this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS       guidelines emphasize that novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; the       Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID-19) also affirm the lack of       evidence to support the clinical use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. WHO guidance       (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pd       f) also strongly affirms that investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics should be done       under ethically approved, randomized, controlled trials. The evidence thus strongly favors       equipoise.     ","       A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for a rapidly spreading pandemic that has       reached 160 countries, infecting over 500,000 individuals and killing more than 24,000       people. SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute and potentially lethal respiratory illness, known as       COVID-19, that is threatening to overwhelm health care systems due to a dramatic surge in       hospitalized and critically ill patients. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have       been symptomatic for 5-7 days prior to admission, indicating that there is a window during       which an effective intervention could significantly alter the course of illness, lessen       disease spread, and alleviate the stress on hospital resources.       There is no known treatment for COVID-19, though in vitro and one poorly controlled study       have identified a potential antiviral activity for HCQ. The rationale for this clinical trial       is to measure the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and       shedding in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19.

There is a more than 50       years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states.       Early data on use of HCQ for COVID treatment suggests anti-viral activity and       immunomodulatory properties for reducing inflammation associated with COVID-19. Given the       lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants in midst of       pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on safety and       early efficacy.       Prior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be       conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related       adverse events and assessed for development of COVID.

The COVID-19 public       health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led       to several healthcare changes that affect obstetrics and gynecology patients, including       delays and cancellations in elective surgery, visitor restrictions, and transitioning from in       person outpatient visits to telemedicine visits. The American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists (ACOG) joined with several other OB/Gyn societies to announce their joint       statement on March 16th, 2020 to reduce the number of elective surgeries in OB/Gyn to free up       healthcare resources. Hospitals and outpatient clinics are instituting visitor restrictions.       Specifically, at Banner University Medical Center - Phoenix (BUMCP), they are not allowing       any visitors with the exception of one visitor for an obstetric laboring patient or for       pediatric patients. All non-essential OB and Gyn visits are transitioning to telemedicine       visits through the telephone or video conferencing platforms, with the exception of obstetric       visits that require labs, vitals, or fetal assessments.       These healthcare changes to OB/Gyn patients is likely impacting their level of stress.       Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can       be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for all       patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including       antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects,       tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps)       may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation       is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in       which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2).       Calm is a mindfulness meditation mobile app that offers a range of mindfulness meditation       practice guide modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. The app includes       meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature       sounds. Few studies on the use of Calm exist and include a randomized controlled trial       evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study       evaluating cancer patient''s perceptions of the app (1,3). There is limited literature on the       effects of mindfulness meditation in obstetrics and gynecology and include its effects on       postoperative pain, infertility, and painful bladder (4-6). During these unprecedented times       of the COVID-19 pandemic, mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially       beneficial to help with stress in OB/Gyn patients, although this requires further       investigation.       The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the mindfulness meditation app Calm       on stress, anxiety, and sleep in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology patients during the       COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will be randomized to two groups; Arm 1 receives a 30 day       free trial at the start of the study, Arm 2 receives a 30 day free trial at the conclusion of       the study. All participants will complete a baseline survey on perceived stress, anxiety, and       sleep at the start of the study, again at 2 weeks into the study, and again one month later.       The investigator''s primary objective is to evaluate perceived stress (validated Perceived       Stress Scale) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, Calm, among outpatient OB/Gyn       patients during COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator''s secondary objectives are to evaluate       anxiety (validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and sleep (validated PROMIS Sleep       Disturbance Short Form) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, Calm, among outpatient       OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the investigators want to assess       feasibility with using the app which includes measurements of adherence and participant       satisfaction with use of the app.     ","       Due to the COVID-19 global health pandemic, many people are likely experiencing increased       stress. Many obstetrics and gynecology patients are additionally experiencing increased       stress due to the healthcare changes the COVID-19 pandemic has caused including delayed or       canceled elective surgeries, visitor restrictions, and telemedicine visits instead of in       person clinic visits. Mindfulness meditation is a self-management strategy that can be       utilized by anyone to assist with the management of stress. Mindfulness meditation mobile       applications, such as the Calm app, can be used to help manage stress, especially during       this uncertain time. The investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial       evaluating perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbance in the investigators outpatient       OB/Gyn patients at Banner Women''s Institute, with the use of a 30 day trial of the       mindfulness meditation app, Calm.

Quantitatively calibrates the nuclear camera to guarantee that the measurements made by            the camera are accurate, consistent and reproducible. This quantification is dependent            upon the isotope being used, the camera and the timing sequence of image acquisition.            Such calibration is NOT currently done and it is part of the patent. Studies have            demonstrated that the lack of this quantitative calibration has resulted in up to 1/3 of            the data being lost for SUV and qualitative interpretation; in addition to making            quantification impossible.         2. The patient presents in a fasting state - to eliminate digestive processes from            interfering with blood flow distributions - and the differences in metabolic and            regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) are enhanced with vasodilatory agents, shifting            blood flow and isotope towards regions of greater blood flow and metabolism; enhancing            isotope delivery, uptake and quantification.         3. With a now quantitatively calibrated nuclear camera - in this instance a PLANAR camera -            or SPECT/CT or PET/CT/MRI if specifically approved - to allow imaging to be done at            patient''s bedside reducing the use of hospital resources required for transport and            decrease potential for patient complications resulting from a transport - image            acquisition will occur for 10-minutes following peak enhancement effect of the            vasodilatory agent and timed injection of the isotope based upon the enhancing agent.            Regions-of-interest (ROIs) will drawn by the nuclear technologist - either at the            bedside or in the nuclear laboratory - to provide FMTVDM measurements using software            already present in the nuclear camera systems. Specific ROIs will be drawn of the right            lung (total), left lung (total), mediastinum (thymus activity), and any specific areas            where increased tracer uptake is noted.         4. These FMTVDM measurements including MAXIMAL COUNTS +/- VARIANCE, provide the values of            the most active pulmonary tissue resulting from the CoVid-19 infection and inflammatory            response; just as it has previously been used for CAD and Cancer.         5. From these FMTVDM measurements, the pulmonary tissue and the CoVid-19 infectious process            results are placed on a Health-Spectrum showing where in the tissue transitioning            process the patient is. The measurements also provide information about how rapidly the            tissue is changing. FMTVDM provides the quantitative measurement of where the patient is            at any point in time during their course of treatment and how they compare with other            patients.         6. Once the FMTVDM measurements have been obtained, treatment decisions can be made based            upon serial changes in FMTVDM. Treatments outcomes are based upon FMTVDM measurements,            including the maximum FMTVDM and the variance in those measurements. By comparing serial            FMTVDM results, improvement or deterioration in the patient''s health and the success or            failure of the current treatment regimen is measured, providing patient-centered,            patient-specific, patient-oriented and patient-directed decisions. Thus saving time,            money, resources and lives - not to mention unnecessary side effects from treatment,            which is not working.     ","       Diagnostic determination of disease and treatment responses has been limited to qualitative       imaging, measurement of serum markers of disease, and sampling of tissue. In each of these       instances, there is a built in error either due to sensitivity and specificity issues,       clinician interpretation of results, or acceptance of the use of an indirect marker (blood       test) of what is happening elsewhere in the body - at the tissue level.       The Fleming Method for Tissue and Vascular Differentiation and Metabolism (FMTVDM) using same       state single or sequential quantification comparisons [1] provides the first and only       patented test (#9566037) - along with the associated submitted patent applications ruled to       be covered under #9566037 - that quantitatively measures changes in tissue resulting from       inter alia a disease process. This includes inter alia coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer       and infectious/inflammatory processes including CoVid-19 pneumonia (CVP) resulting from the       metabolic and regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) caused by these diseases.       The purpose of this paper is to make clinicians and researchers aware of this proposed method       for investigating the prevalence and severity of CVP - in addition to providing rapid       determination of treatment response in each patient, directing treatment decisions; thereby       reducing the loss of time, money, resources and patient lives.

In the first 3 weeks of the       COVID-19 pandemic within Michigan over 3300 patients tested positive through our system and       over 1000 have been admitted for inpatient care. COVID-19 has a wide range of presentations       from asymptomatic to multisystem organ failure and death. Spread from asymptomatic       individuals has been described in the literature but the extent of this transmission is       unclear. Large scale serologic testing can help address this question by detecting antibodies       generated after an individual is infected with COVID-19. Healthcare workers have developed       COVID-19 but the true infection rate among those who care for COVID-19 patients and whether       the infection occurs at work is unknown.       Every day, thousands of Beaumont physicians, nurses, technicians and other caregivers are       working under extraordinary stress, doing their very best to care for patients with this       highly contagious and potentially deadly virus. They are trying to protect themselves from       infection while dealing with personal protective equipment requirements and limited knowledge       of who in the hospital environment may be carrying the infection and potentially spreading it       among the staff. Caregivers are at greater risk of infection than the public, and when they       become sick, it reduces the number of trained personnel available to care for hospitalized       patients. Serological testing would give Beaumont''s front-line staff and patients peace of       mind by determining infection rates in our care units. Knowing the infection rates will       demonstrate how effective the use of personal protective equipment has been for staff,       whether any flaws exist in the system, and how many clinical staff currently have potentially       protective antibodies.       Beaumont Health has 2 EURO Lab Workstations capable of running the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA       EUROIMMUN serology assay (referred to as the EUROIMMUN assay hereafter). Each EUROIMMUN assay       consists of 2 separate tests; one of which measures IgG (the memory antibody which should       give long acting resistance to people who mount an immune response) and the second of which       measures IgA (the secretory antibody that should protect against infection through mucous       membranes). Researchers can run 5,000 samples a day with each sample being tested for IgA and       IgG.       Potential participants (employees and affiliated non-employed physicians and advanced       practice providers) will provide informed consent. Researchers will analyze all participants       over 2 blood draws between 2 and 4 weeks apart to see if they developed antibodies to       COVID-19. Participants at medium risk for exposure in their job function at Beaumont will       have 3 draws 2-4 weeks apart and people considered the highest risk, those who provide the       direct patient care to COVID-19 patients, will be tested 2-4 weeks apart until the pandemic       in Michigan is under control (estimated to be 8 blood draws). If the participants agree,       researchers will bank 0.5 ml of serum for future testing related to COVID-19. An initial       questionnaire and subsequent questionnaires with each blood draw will be completed by       participants. Biostatistics will analyze the data from the questionnaires and the serology       test to determine any links between level of risk associated with the participants job,       medical history, and exposure history to development of COVID-19 antibodies. Participants       medical records will be monitored for one year to see if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 and       if they have a positive PCR test for COVID-19 since they were tested for the presence of       antibodies. All employees identified as developing COVID-19 after their antibody levels were       tested will be analyzed and a correlation between antibody level and development of COVID-19       will be generated. This will allow an estimation of the protective effect of antibodies       relative to people who have no detectable antibodies. Researchers will perform an       epidemiologic analysis to identify contacts between staff and patients based on records in       the EMR and can cross reference to determine if nosocomial transmission is likely occurring       from staff to patients and vice versa. Researchers will also determine if there was any       likely exposure to patients with COVID-19 on the same floor or if prior patients in the room       had COVID-19. This will also allow researchers to model the rate of spread of the virus       within the hospital from unknown sources.     ","       The purpose of this study is to determine how peoples'' bodies respond to exposure to       COVID-19. Employees of Beaumont Health in Michigan who are older than 18 years may be       eligible to participate. Participants will have blood drawn two or more times for serology       testing. This serology test will determine if participants have detectable levels of the       antibodies that our bodies develop to fight COVID-19 infection. Participants will fill out a       questionnaire each time they provide a blood sample. The questionnaires include questions       about participants'' personal traits; their health; general questions about their risk to       exposure; job and risk of exposure; symptoms, diagnosis, treatment of COVID-19 since last       blood draw. Researchers will monitor participants'' medical records in a confidential manner       for one year after the last blood draw to help determine if people who develop antibodies to       COVID-19 are protected against developing a COVID-19 infection in the future.There may be no       direct benefits for participants; however, information from this study may benefit other       people by increasing our understanding of COVID-19, how it spreads from person to person, and       how people respond to fight off the infection.The results of the serology test are used for       research only and will not affect clinical decisions regarding participants'' treatment or       quarantine     ","Serology testing of Beaumont Health employees will allow an estimation of asymptomatic carriage and help determine level of nosocomial spread of COVID-19 within our institution among its employees.

All interactions for this       study will be conducted remotely by videoconferencing, email, or phone.       Screening: All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible       for the study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will       send the study materials. These materials will consist of study medication and       self-monitoring equipment, including a pregnancy test (for females of childbearing age not       using contraception), an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer.       Once the study team has finalized the screening process, the participant will begin taking       the study medication.       RCT: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or a placebo.       This phase of the study will last approximately 15 days and is double-blinded. Participants       will take 100mg of fluvoxamine or placebo by mouth three times a day for a daily total of       300mg. They will continue this dose for approximately 15 days. Depending on tolerability, the       dose may be adjusted. Participants will also complete short 10-15 minute assessments daily to       assess symptoms, results of self-monitoring (including oxygen level, blood pressure, and       temperature) and any adverse events.       Open-label Phase: After completing the randomization phase, participants will then       participate in an open-label phase (participant will definitely receive fluvoxamine) that       will last up to 15 days. Those randomized to placebo will have the opportunity to try       fluvoxamine during this time. Those randomized to fluvoxamine will continue this medication       while slowly decreasing the drug. The participant may opt out of this phase. The dosage       during this time will be 50-100mg two times daily until discontinuing the drug. Participants       will also continue completing short 10-15 minute daily assessments to assess physical       symptoms, vitals, and any adverse events.       Follow-up Phase: We will follow participants for approximately 30 days after the end of the       randomized phase.

Aims/Objectives            The effectiveness of blockade of IL-6R in treating patients with COVID-19 disease of            moderate severity will be tested in a pragmatic and adaptive randomized trial. The            primary outcome is intubation or death within 14 days of enrollment. Secondary outcomes            include time to hospital discharge if alive, time to clinical recovery as was defined in            a recent study [1], ICU length of stay, time to return to normal or baseline oxygen            saturation, and changes in laboratory biomarkers.         2. Background Information            SARS-COV-2 is a novel human pathogen that emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread            worldwide. Clinical disease caused by this novel infection has a high mortality rate,            particularly in older adults and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease,            populations that are highly prevalent within the VA healthcare system. This creates an            urgent need for the VA to quickly and efficiently identify effective therapies to reduce            mortality and spread of the disease. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, potential            treatment options include anti-viral drugs (such as antimalarials or medications            originally developed to treat HIV infection (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir)),            anti-inflammatory drugs, including IL-6 inhibition, and innovations in supportive care,            such as placing patients in prone positioning while awake and not intubated.            Importantly, in the context of the global pandemic and exponential spread of the            disease, clinical trials must be designed in a manner that 1) optimizes outcomes for            Veterans, and 2) produces rapid answers, so that effective treatments can be deployed            quickly to reduce unnecessary deaths. Based on a review of 384 ongoing clinical trials            by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and a daily search of open clinical trials,            many conventional controlled clinical trials of antiviral drugs and cytokine-blocking            drugs are in progress and are likely to be completed within a few months; however, it is            possible that these trials, which may take months to implement and report results, will            not yield any information about how to treat patients until after the peak of the            pandemic is over. A secondary challenge is that it is important to identify what works            and what does not work quickly, so that manufacturers can understand what medications            need to be produced so that supply chains are adequate for treating all patients who            might benefit from an intervention. Thus, innovative clinical trial methodologies are            needed in order to produce answers in a highly compressed time frame to inform medical            decision-making and supply chain management.            This novel and innovative proposal concerns use and comparison an existing drug            (sarilumab) that blocks the receptor for the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Most studies of            IL-6 pathway blockade are using IV medications and include restrictive eligibility            criteria and are directed towards patients with severe disease. We hypothesize that            patients earlier in the disease course - prior to severe respiratory decompensation -            might benefit the most from IL-6 inhibition, and thus are the population included in            this pragmatic trial. This study will expand our knowledge and understanding about how            IL-6 inhibition can be used to prevent disease progression in patients with moderate            disease. It will use a more readily available subcutaneous, longer-acting formulation            directed towards patients with moderate disease, of whom 25-35% can progress to severe            disease, often rapidly. Eligibility criteria allow for a broad range of underlying            choices of other medications, including antiviral medications such as remdesivir and            hydroxychloroquine, among others, baseline laboratory values, and comorbidities,            reflecting likely real-world clinical use. Thus, this pragmatic project would fill a            major gap in research about the clinical care of patients with COVID-19.         3. Rationale and Purpose            Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome            (ARDS) followed by a severe cardiomyopathy in many cases. Based on currently available            data, it is unclear how much of the respiratory damage in COVID-19 is due to direct            effects of SARS-COV-2, or if the primary driver of severe disease is the inflammatory            response generated in response to the virus. The key role of inflammation in the            progression of the disease is highlighted by recent studies, which demonstrate that            patients who progress to requiring ICU-level care no longer have detectable virus            present in their respiratory tract. Thus, identifying drugs that could dampen the            inflammatory response prior to severe clinical decompensation without adversely            affecting clearance of virus would be clinically useful and lead to improved outcomes.            Elevated biomarkers of severe inflammation (such as IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and            lymphopenia) have been strongly associated with severe disease and increased mortality            in patients with COVID-19 [2,3], and early development of a strong IgG response may            paradoxically be a poor prognostic sign during the acute phase of the disease. In            contrast, viral load in upper respiratory secretions at baseline is only modestly            associated with clinical outcomes, and viral load declines in most patients after            presentation, independent of the clinical course of the disease [4]. Severe disease            typically arises more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, a time at which virus is usually            no longer detectable. These findings suggest that progression to severe disease may be            driven more by the inflammatory response to the disease than a direct viral effect, and            point to anti-inflammatory drugs as potentially critical therapeutic options.            Importantly, high dose glucocorticoids have been found to be ineffective in severe            COVID-19 and are associated with somewhat worse outcomes, so other more targeted            anti-inflammatory options are urgently needed.            Blockade of IL-6 signaling is a particularly attractive approach. Sarilumab and            tocililzumab are antibodies to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), FDA-approved for long-term            treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab has been used open-label with enough            anecdotal success in enough patients in China [5] that the manufacturers of sarilumab            and tocilizumab have rapidly opened clinical trials in multiple countries at assess            efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Tocilizumab has also demonstrated            efficacy in reducing mortality associated with the cytokine release syndrome in patients            receiving CAR-T treatment for cancer, in which the pathogenic pathway is widespread            T-cell activation, which leads to production of pleiotropic inflammatory cytokines such            as IL-6 by monocytes. Although trials attempting to rescue patients with severe COVID-19            with ARDS and/or cardiomyopathy are essential and are in progress, the ideal population            for clinical use may be patients who are not yet critically ill but are at high risk of            clinical deterioration due to secondary inflammation.         4. Relevance to Veterans Health            COVID-19 has a high mortality rate of 2-3% among symptomatic patients. It is expected to            have a particularly high mortality in Veterans, because age >60, underlying            cardiovascular or lung disease, and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality            and clinical deterioration. Thus, advances in care of patients sick enough to be            hospitalized yet prior to ICU admission are expected to have particular benefit for            Veterans.         5. Study Design       Design. Prospective, randomized, unblinded interventional clinical trial.       Two arms: standard care, based on established practices within the medical center, or       standard care plus subcutaneous sarilumab.       Assignment Strategy: Randomized play-the-winner design, such that randomization becomes       weighted toward the arm that was more effective in previous enrolled subjects. The       probability of randomization to a specific arm (standard of care or standard of care plus       intervention) will be updated based on outcomes in blocks of 10-20 subjects (see Planned       Statistical Analyses). There is an option for open-label use of sarilumab in the       standard-care group in the event the primary outcome (intubation) is met. Such patients may       also receive any other treatment per the judgment of their treating physician.       Data will be extracted remotely from the EHR. No data will be generated specifically for       study purposes.     ","       Objectives: To determine whether blockade of IL-6R is beneficial in patients with COVID-19       infection of moderate severity.       Research Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Two-arm trial comparing standard care alone to       standard care with addition of sarilumab (anti-IL6R). The trial will use a randomized       play-the-winner design, in which randomization becomes weighted toward the arm that was more       effective in previous subjects in the trial.       Methodology Hospitalized patients meeting clinical criteria for moderate disease and testing       positive for coronavirus infection. Interventions: sarilumab, one subcutaneous treatment of       200 mg. Standard care is not pre-specified, may vary among patients, and may include agents       with anti-viral activity, such as remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine, among others. Up to 120       patients, primary outcome intubation or death within 14 days. All data will be extracted       remotely from the EHR.       Clinical Implications: The study has potential to establish IL-6R blockade, delivered       subcutaneously, as standard of care in reducing progression to critical illness in patients       with moderate COVID-19 disease.

Food insecurity in a family is detrimental to a child''s mental and physical health,       and poses a risk to his/her development. Food insecurity prevalence has also been reported       higher than the state level prevalence in households impacted by disasters. It is therefore       reasonable to hypothesize that the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic has increased the       frequency of food insecurity among lower income families. However, no data are known about       the current incidence of food insecurity during a pandemic with quarantine procedures in       place. This knowledge will also add background for future studies on the effects of acute on       chronic food insecurity on low-income families facing similar adversities such as this       epidemic.       A 2-question tool has been validated to evaluate the presence of food insecurity. An       affirmative response to either question has been reported to yield a sensitivity of 97% and       specificity of 83-86%. Screening for basic needs may open a sensitive discussion about       economic difficulties associated with the adverse health outcomes previously discussed. While       this tool is a current standard of care as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics,       it is often not utilized in medical visits to a primary care provider whether for routine       well child care or for sick visits. During the study period, pediatricians at two FQHC       clinics will make a concentrated effort to ask these 2 screening questions in order to       collect data on the prevalence and magnitude of challenges of food insecurity at this time.       Although the investigators are seeking to evaluate the current standard of care, they may       want to share our findings in order to provide a foundation for more generalizable research.       The investigators will seek to take a random sampling of 500 pediatric patients (250 each       from 2 CommUnity Care clinics) and query the parent/guardian with the 2-question food       insecurity tool during their regular appointment, either in person or on the       phone/telehealth. The pediatricians (Co-Inv) will ask the questions and record the data.       2-questions to assess food insecurity as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics:         1. We worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more. Was that            often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months?         2. The food we bought just didn''t last, and we didn''t have money to get more. Was that            often true, sometimes true, or never true for your household in the last 12 months? A            response of often true or sometimes true to either question = positive screen for            Food Insecurity.       The investigators will also ask the same 2 questions in the framework of …in the last 1-2       months to assess how the current situation has affected their immediate concerns. If the       parent/guardian response with a positive screen for food insecurity, the pediatrician will       refer the families to available community resources as is the usual standard of care.       The investigators will not record any identifiable information. This is not a longitudinal       study. In 4-6 months the investigators will repeat this procedure with another, different       random sampling of 500 patients to assess any long lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic       or to determine if the immediate food crisis due to the pandemic has passed. The       investigators requested a waiver of consent for this project.     ",       The investigators suspect that the current COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with a high       level of unsuspected food insecurity among lower income Austin families who receive their       health care at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). Pediatricians will ask families       about food insecurity as part of standard of care in order to assess if food insecurity has       begun or worsened during the pandemic.     ,"2-questions to assess food insecurity as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics: We worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more.

INTRODUCTION, RATIONALE The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late       2019 and has quickly become a pandemic, significantly impacting the health and economy of the       United States and the rest of the world. (1,2) There are over 500,000 cases and 24,000 deaths       related to COVID-19 worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate ranging from 1-8%. (1,2) The       United States has been impacted by this pandemic significantly with over 80,000 cases and       thousands of deaths reported; these numbers will continue to worsen.(1) Patients infected       with COVID-19 can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from an       asymptomatic state to mild upper respiratory symptoms (with low-grade fever) to severe       disease with hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) type lung injury.(3,4) In       the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure, ground glass opacification on chest imaging is       found more than 50% of the time. (3) COVID-19 has the potential to cause myocardial injury       with at least 17% found to have an elevated troponin and 23% noted to have heart failure in a       study of 191 inpatients from Wuhan, China. (5) The prevalence of heart failure was       significantly higher among non-survivors compared with survivors (52% vs. 12%). In a       meta-analysis of 4 studies including a total of 341 patients, standardized mean difference of       cardiac troponin I levels were significantly higher in those with severe COVID-19 related       illness compared to those with non-severe disease (25.6, 95% CI 6.8-44.5) (6). Furthermore,       cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock have also been reported, with       associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. (7,8) In a recent report from Wuhan, China,       16.7% of hospitalized and 44.4% of ICU patients with COVID-19 had cardiac arrhythmias. (9)       Given the potential sampling bias in sicker, hospitalized patients with hypoxia and       electrolyte abnormalities in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac       arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe       illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown.       Furthermore, as it is currently unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with       COVID-19. Several medications eg: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, tocilizumab       etc. are currently being investigated. Hydroxychloroquine is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and       can cause drug-induced LQT.(10) As such, these drugs are used concomitantly with other       antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, Tikosyn, sotalol etc. which can be associated with       QT prolongation requiring close EKG and cardiac monitoring. Improved characterization of       arrhythmia burden and mechanism of death is critical, primarily in guiding the need for       developing treatment strategies, additional arrhythmia monitoring and need to consider       advanced prevention strategies including the role of implantable cardioverter defibrillator       (ICD).     ","       The objective of the study is to estimate the frequency of cardiac arrhythmias and       characterize the mode of death in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Povidone-iodine has been shown to have virucidal properties against multiple viruses       including against the virus that causes SARS which is very similar in makeup to the virus       causing COVID-19.       The investigators hypothesize that 4x daily use of oral gargles and nasal rinses using a       povidone iodine solution will help to reduce the viral load in the nasopharynx and oropharynx       in patients who are COVID-19+. If this hypothesis is shown to be true this could potentially       have an impact on time to recovery of clinical symptoms as well as reduce shedding of the       virus by infected patients. A time course of 7 days was chosen in order to recognize a trend       in the viral load over time for patients receiving each of the interventions.

First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many       patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be       under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T       cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)       infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell       exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple       cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially       explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of       COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based       approaches.       CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises       the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown       that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or       danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have       demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19.       First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc,       but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple       inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing       hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated       severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting       immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in       preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of       multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T       cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly       noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey       from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological       modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into       blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild       symptom, or disease progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or ESMO or death, as the       two co-primary endpoints.

These patients often require intubation and       ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is       intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in       order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and       improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians       treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many       cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.       PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in       the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting       and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one       of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings.       The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a       bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of       the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save       lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially       ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to       improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.

Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in these patients.       This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus       has been designated COVID-19 and has infected hundreds of thousands of confirmed individuals       in more than 200 countries. Currently there are no approved therapeutic agents available for       coronaviruses. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic       patients but also to decrease the duration of virus transmission in the community. Among       candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for use as antiviral       treatments is proposed because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, and drug       interactions are well known. A clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients showed       that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral       clearance, when comparing to controls groups. Chinese experts recommend that patients       diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without       contraindications to chloroquine, be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten       days. Hydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an       anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than       that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer       concerns about drug-drug interactions.       Gautret recently reported a clinical trial to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine and       azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in France. Early results, focusing on       virological data in twenty patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections       receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group, showed a significant reduction       of the viral carriage after 6 days of treatment compared to controls, and much lower average       carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added       to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. The molecular       mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has not been fully elucidated but       they are believed to change the pH at the surface of the cell membrane and thus, inhibit the       fusion of the virus to the cell membrane, as well as inhibit nucleic acid replication,       glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, virus release       and other processes to achieve its antiviral effects.       Yao et.al recently reported antiviral and prophylactic activity of hydroxychloroquine and       chloroquine in vitro, concluding that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine at       inhibiting SARS CoV 2 in vitro and that hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily       for day 1 (loading dose) followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to       treat SARS CoV 2 infection.       In silico screening of FDA licensed compound libraries against the SARS CoV 2 protease Plpro       catalytic site was performed using solved crystal structures of the protein. Plpro       (Papain-like protease) is an early acting protease responsible for initial processing of the       SARS CoV2 polyprotein into active subunits. Plpro also has ubiquitinase activity, and is       implicated in early infection phase inhibition of innate (interferon) immune responses which       otherwise would suppress viral replication. A ranked list of licensed compounds with       predicted binding activity in the Plpro catalytic site was computationally generated, and the       Plpro catalytic site binding pose of each of the top compounds was examined and ranked by a       team of pharmaceutical chemists. Package inserts or product monographs for the licensed       compounds which generated high computational binding scores and passed inspection were then       reviewed and used to rank compounds based on adverse events, warnings, drug interactions       on-target mechanisms, pharmacokinetic and absorption, metabolism, excretion and toxicity       (ADMET), protein binding and available therapeutic window considerations. Famotidine       (Pepcid), a histamine H2 antagonist widely available over-the-counter, was repeatedly       computationally scored among the highest of the compounds tested, and was associated with the       most favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. A series of analogs of famotidine were       generated using PubChem, and many of these scored even higher as potential candidates. This       control compound set further confirmed the predicted binding of the molecular backbone       chemotype at the Plpro protease/ubiquitinase site. Currently available as oral and IV       products, famotidine has a very attractive proven safety, drug interaction, and therapeutic       window profile. Samples of famotidine have been submitted at Southern Research and IITRI for       in vitro testing in COVID-19 cultures. Unpublished anecdotal case studies suggest clinical       benefits associated with administration of famotidine 40 mg PO TID in mild COVID-19       infection.     ","       The overall objective of the study will be to evaluate the clinical efficacy of COVID-19       treatments consisting of standard of care (SOC) combined with pharmaceutical antiviral       management using hydroxychloroquine, or SOC with hydroxychloroquine combined with high-dose       intravenous famotidine, in hospitalized patients meeting nucleic acid diagnostic and       radiologic criteria for COVID-19 disease. The trial will statistically compare the clinical       benefit afforded by the two treatment strategies to internal historical standard of care       data from Northwell patents treated without benefit of either hydroxychloroquine or high-dose       famotidine. We will compare clinical outcomes associated with hydroxychloroquine and the       addition of high-dose intravascular famotidine. The trial is designed to enroll at least 600       COVID-19 patients hospitalized with moderate to severe disease into each of the two active       treatment arms, with a total enrollment target of at least 1200 patients.

It is estimated that COVID-19 will be       lethal for up to 200,000 Americans. Several cardiovascular manifestations have been reported       to be associated with the disease or its treatment and might be contributing to its high       mortality rates.1,2 The National Health Commission of China (NHC) documented that       approximately 12% of patients without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) who expired in the       setting of COVID-19 had either elevated cardiac troponin I levels or a cardiac arrest during       hospitalization.3 Furthermore, patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities       experience worse outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2.1 Acute myocarditis, acute myocardial       injury, and heart failure have been associated with COVID-19.3 However, most of these       associations come from small observational studies or from comparisons with other       coronaviruses.3 The hypothesized pathogenetic mechanism of CVD in COVID-19 includes either       direct effects of the virus to the cardiac cells expressing the angiotensin- converting       enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, or indirect effects from the severe systemic inflammatory response,       cytokine surge and immune system activation. The exact effect of COVID-19 on the       cardiovascular system though is still not well known. This study seeks to identify the       prevalence of CVD and its role in clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with       COVID-19 in a large tertiary center of Houston, TX. CVD associated with COVID-19 might be       contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention, early       diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study       assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients.       Methods:       Study population and data handling:       A retrospective observational case-control study will be performed. Multiple hospitals will       participate in the current study and the study protocol will be submitted separately to each       local IRB for approval. Subjects admitted to the participating hospitals from March 30th,       2020 to March 30th, 2021, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will be identified through       the microbiology lab registry. Subjects who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR will       be age- and gender-matched with subjects admitted to the hospital with similar symptoms but       negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 (one negative PCR test for patients of low clinical       suspicion and two negative tests, 24 hours apart from each other, for patients of high       clinical suspicion). Demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be collected       by retrospective electronic chart review.

","       Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for       the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first reports of COVID-19 came from Wuhan,       China in December of 2019. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly around the globe,       accounting for thousands of deaths in multiple countries. On March 11th, 2020, the World       Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Although COVID-19 manifests primarily as       a respiratory illness, several cardiovascular implications have been reported related to its       natural course and treatment. Its exact effect on the cardiovascular system though is       currently unknown. Therefore, we propose a retrospective, observational, case-control study       looking for cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including laboratory evidence of       myocardial injury, electrocardiographic changes, arrhythmias and echocardiographic       abnormalities. Hospitalized patients admitted with fever, cough, sore throat, and/or dyspnea       who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be included in our study and will be matched       based on their age and gender with patients admitted with similar symptoms who tested       negative for SARS-CoV-2. The electronic medical charts of the study subjects will be reviewed       and relevant demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings will be deidentified and       recorded. Since our study will be a retrospective chart review study it carries minimal risk       for the patients and the investigators. Cardiovascular disease associated with COVID-19 might       be contributing to the high mortality rates and its recognition will allow for prevention,       early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This will be the first, large, case-control study       assessing cardiovascular involvement of COVID-19 in a well-defined cohort of patients.

The lifetime prevalence of anxiety in       MS is estimated at 48.9%, compared to 37.9% in the general population. The negative       consequences of anxiety for individuals with MS include impairment of work function and       workplace attrition, increased healthcare usage and healthcare costs, increased physical       disability (i.e., higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score), and reduced overall       quality of life. And while anxiety has been shown to be acutely elevated both before and in       the first years after diagnosis, individuals with longstanding MS also exhibit anxiety at       higher rates than the general population. Of note, women are at heightened risk for both       anxiety and MS, and lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased prevalence       of anxiety in MS. In the SUNLIGHT study, participants join a structured meeting in which they       receive content specifically focused on anxiety, its detrimental impact on individuals with       MS, and an emphasis on techniques to reduce anxiety. Over the 12-week period of the       intervention, participants learn techniques for stress reduction that can be       self-administered, such that the benefits of participation outlive the active period of the       intervention.     ","       Stress and anxiety can have an adverse impact on health, and the experience of many around       the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 is affecting health and well-being.

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors       for death in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the       renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell       entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)       and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in       several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not       consistent across studies. Alternatively, ACEIs and ARBs may actually improve mechanisms of       host defense or hyperinflammation, ultimately reducing organ injury. Finally, ACEIs and ARBs       may have direct renal, pulmonary and cardiac protective benefits in the setting of COVID-19.       Therefore, it is unclear if ACEIs and ARBs may be beneficial or harmful in patients with       COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease in the       world, the high prevalence of ACEIs or ARBs in these conditions, and the clinical equipoise       regarding the continuation vs. discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID, a       randomized trial is urgently needed.

A draft paper was released recently in March by Didier Raoult       from Aix-Marseille University in France on a preliminary trial of 36 COVID-19 patients. In       this trial, 6 patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory symptoms, and 8 had lower       respiratory symptoms. Between early and mid-March, they treated 20 of these patients with 600       mg of hydroxychloroquine daily in a hospital setting. Some patient also received the       antibiotic azithromycin. 16 patients served as the controls. They observed a significant       reduction in viral load in patients with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, 70% of the treated       patients were considered cured (no virus detected in their samples) compared to 12.5% of       controls. All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative       for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial.       Vitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the       development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness.

Current estimates suggest that the       novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive rate, 2-3)       and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality rate,       0.5-5%). Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently       needed.       Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with       immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related       compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies       conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro,       hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus       chloroquine.       Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of       developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been       found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously,       hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases.       This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19       symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If       hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among       people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of       the COVID-19 epidemic.

Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP)       has assembled a team of committed virologists, molecular biologists, chemists, and       technologists to address this emerging threat. Monoclonal antibodies have become great       additions to our therapeutic arsenal, primarily in treating cancer or autoimmune diseases.       Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies in combating infections such as respiratory       syncytial virus and HIV have also become clear. In recent years, advanced cell sorting and       sequencing technologies have been utilized to identify neutralizing antibodies from human B       cells. This protocol will outline our approach to obtaining blood specimens from participants       who are recovering from COVID-19 infection. Potential participants will be referred by health       care providers from within the CUIMC/NYP system and from outside institutions. If the       potential participant agrees to be contacted, study staff will call them to review the       informed consent, eligibility criteria and study procedures, and set up a study visit for       blood draw. Monoclonal antibodies that could potently neutralize 2019 novel coronavirus       (2019-nCoV) and related coronaviruses will be isolated from these specimens. Candidate       monoclonal antibodies will then be optimized and evaluated for therapeutic potential. The       ultimate goal would be able to produce a monoclonal antibody that could confer protection       during an outbreak or be utilized to treat patients with severe COVID disease.     ","       Blood samples from participants who have recovered from COVID-19 infection will be obtained       and studied. The goal of the research is to identify antibodies that have been generated by       the patient to fight the COVID-19 infection. By identifying the most effective antibodies,       scientists can make specific antibodies to use to prevent future coronavirus outbreaks or to       treat patients with severe disease.     ","The blood specimen will be proceeded into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma to be stored for testing. In brief, CD27+ memory B cells that can bind to a SARS-CoV-2 S protein bait will be sorted by flow cytometry and RNA will be extracted to obtain heavy and light chain sequences. Antibody sequences will be annotated using bioinformatics approaches, and candidate sequences will be cloned. Purified antibodies will be characterized and neutralization breadth and potency against SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses will be assessed using neutralization assays.",Number of antibodies against coronaviruses isolated and identified from patient samples,Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NYP; New York; New York; 10032; Brett Gray,"Yang Luo, PhD; 2123046205; yl4459@cumc.columbia.edu"

A recent study conducted at The Everett Clinic showed that foam nasal swabs were       able to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at comparable levels to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. We now       look to build off this work by comparing polyester foam swabs, which are more readily       available and mass producible, to foam nasal swabs, in their sensitivity for detecting       SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also plan to assess the viability of dry swabbing, where the swab is       stored without saline or viral transport media (VTM) at room temperature for four days, to       calculate the degradation of the viral sample.       Finally, we will collect up to 50 mL/visit of blood longitudinally from patients who have       previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at visit one, two, and four weeks following their       initial COVID-10 diagnosis.The medical professional drawing the blood will determine if the       patient is at an increased risk from a blood draw due to underlying conditions such as       anemia. In these cases, the amount of blood drawn will be left to the discretion of the       medical professional but shall not surpass 10 mL per visit.These longitudinal blood samples       will help us gain a better understanding of the trajectory of COVID-19 (in terms of both       clinical symptomology and viral load) and antibody development.

The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a            breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health            interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be            implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.

The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the       viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary       function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage       and inflammatory changes that accompanied.       This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to       examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged       tissues.       Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic       Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders,       showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study,       driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage       within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and       scarring reaction.       The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization       potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature       and in scientific studies.       Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that       survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative       new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as Functional Respiratory       Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung       tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month       intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency       at those intervals.       Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive       clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in       time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created       by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that       is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with       the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the       trials.

Delirium according to the DSM-5 is defined if criterium A-E are fulfilled: A. Disturbance in       attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and       awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). B. The disturbance develops over a short       period of time (usually hours to a few days) represents a change from baseline attention and       awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of the day. C. An additional       disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial       ability, or perception). D. The disturbances in criteria A and C are not explained by another       pre-existing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the       context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma. E. There is evidence from the       history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct       physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal       (i.e. because of a drug of abuse medication), or exposure to a toxin, or is because of       multiple etiologies.

The infection affects all ages of life, although affecting       children in a very small proportion of cases. The typical presentation of the disease       combines fever (98%), cough (76%), myalgia and asthenia (18%) as well as leukopenia (25%) and       lymphopenia (63%). Upper airway involvement rare.       The main clinical presentation requiring hospitalization of infected patients is that of       atypical pneumonia which may require critical care management (27%), and progress to an acute       respiratory distress syndrome (67%) involving life-threatening conditions in almost 25% of       patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other organ damage have been reported, mainly       concerning kidney damage (29%) which may require renal replacement therapy in approximately       17% of patients.       Neurological damage has been very rarely studied, yet reported in 36% of cases in a study       including patients of varying severity.       Finally, the mortality associated with this emerging virus is high in patients for whom       critical care management is necessary, reported in 62% of patients.       We therefore propose a prospective observational study which aim at reporting the prevalence       of acute encephalopathy at initial management in Critical/Intensive care or Neurocritical       care , to report its morbidity and mortality and to identify prognostic factors.

De-identified databases derived       from the study records may be made available to other researchers and may be retained by       those organizations indefinitely based on the terms of the agreement under which the data was       provided.       SOURCE DOCUMENTS Source data can include clinical findings and observations, or other       information incorporated into the registry database to support analysis of data. Source data       is all information from which information in the registry database is derived in original       form (or certified copies of an original record). Examples of these original documents and       records include but are not limited to the following: electronic medical records, clinical       and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, correspondence, subjects'' diaries or       patient-reported questionnaires, data from automated instruments, such as ECG machines,       photographs and other imaging (DICOM) files, slides, pharmacy records, and the reports       documenting medical interpretation of those files.       Data may be entered into the eCRF either manually by the study team performing data       abstraction from the EMR or electronically using direct entry of data into the or from an       electronic import of data. Patients may also enter information directly into the eCRF using a       patient-facing survey functionality either over the Web or using a smartphone app. Data       elements originating in EMR may be automatically transmitted directly into the eCRF using a       suitable API. Source data derived in that manner may have an intervening process, such as       abstraction by third-party including software including processing using machine learning       algorithms prior to transferring to the eCRF. xCures will retain source records in a secure       that will be maintained separately and securely from the eCRF. However, metadata tagging may       be employed to electronically map source data back from the eCRF to the source data record to       create an audit trail.       DISCONTINUATION OF PARTICIPATION       Participants can withdraw from the registry at any time by sending a written request to       xCures. Withdrawal from the study means that no additional data will be collected from the       patient and does not constitute revocation of the right to use the data collected prior to       withdrawal for the purposes described herein. xCures may discontinue the study at any time       for any reason.

","       Background: During the current COVID-19 pandemic there is urgent need for information about       the natural history of the infection in non-hospitalized patients, including the severity and       duration of symptoms, and outcome from early in the infection, among different subgroups of       patients. In addition, a large, real-world data registry can provide information about how       different concomitant medications may differentially affect symptoms among patient subgroups.       Such information can be invaluable for clinicians managing chronic diseases during this       pandemic, as well as identify interventions undertaken in a naturalistic setting that have       differential effects. Such factors may include patient diet, over the counter or prescription       medications, and herbal and alternative treatments, among others. Identifying the natural       disease history in patients from different demographic and disease subgroups will be       important for identifying at-risk patients and effectiveness of interventions undertaken in       the community.       Objectives: The purpose of this study is to understand at the population level the       symptomatic course of known or suspected COVID-19 patients while sheltering-in-place or under       quarantine. Symptoms will be measured using a daily report derived from the CTCAE-PRO as well       as free response.

Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The       clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory       tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.       In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea       is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome       from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical       ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of       the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the       majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in       spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved       morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.       In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose       ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At       the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in       an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities       between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While       further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the       effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when       administered at an early stage.     ","       The scientific community is in search for novel therapies that can help to face the ongoing       epidemics of novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) originated in China in December 2019. At present,       there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary       data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects       on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses.

If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this       treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).       Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards       of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful       management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from       concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will       actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to       study arms.       The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a       recovered status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those       subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity       subgroup (those with baseline status of Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen or       Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care) is also       of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20,       2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With       recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.       Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the       hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For       discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain       safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as       well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the       ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be       conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have       laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.       All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety       laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs       will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized).       OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and       29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).       The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates       treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known       about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size       reassessment.

The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying       infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is       standard-of-care. Therapy is generally not given to persons who are not hospitalized. The       doses of hydroxychloroquine being used are within the normal standard FDA-approved doses.       Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID-19       disease or early preemptive therapy may decrease disease severity.

Patients are excluded if       they were transferred from an out-of-system hospital, died within 24 hours of presentation to       the ED, or were admitted for less than 24 hours. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as       a patient that had a positive reverse-transcriptase-polymerase- chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay       for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample.       Patients are risk stratified by severity of symptoms on presentation to the hospital as mild,       moderate, or severe COVID-19. Patients without hypoxia or exertional dyspnea were considered       to have mild COVID-19. Patients with mild COVID-19 were treated with symptom relief only and       not admitted to the hospital. Patients who presented with infiltrates on chest radiography       and required supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or HFNC were classified as having moderate       COVID-19. Patients who had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were       classified as having severe COVID-19.       This is a multi-center quasi-experimental study at HFHS, comprised of five hospitals in       southeast and south-central Michigan. The study was approved by the institution''s       Investigational Review Board (#13739) with waiver of consent. Patients in the       pre-corticosteroid protocol group from March 12, 2020 through March 19, 2020 were compared to       a corticosteroid protocol group that included patients from March 20, 2020 through March 27,       2020.       Patients in both study groups received standard care, comprised of supplemental oxygen, HFNC,       invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, vasopressor support, and       renal-replacement therapy, as determined by the primary team. Patients who progressed to ARDS       were managed with standard of care.       Data was ascertained from each institution''s electronic medical record and recorded in a       standardized electronic case report form. Demographic data, information on clinical symptoms       or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during admission. All       laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed       tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.       Coexisting conditions were ascertained from electronic medical record and physician       documentation. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was collected to evaluate baseline       illness severity based on vital signs obtained in the Emergency Department. Additionally, the       quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) was used to evaluate severity of illness of       included patients based on ED vitals and examination. All patients were followed for at least       14 days after initial presentation. Patient data was censored on April 9, 2020.       Statistical Analysis: Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile range       (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney test or t-test, as appropriate. Categorical data       was reported as number and percentage (no., %) and compared using the chi-squared test or       Fisher''s exact test, as appropriate. No imputation was made for missing data points. The       sample size was derived from all eligible consecutive hospitalized patients during the study       period. A two-sided α < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Bivariate and       multivariable logistic regression analysis was planned a-priori to test the association       between the composite endpoint and exposure to the corticosteroid protocol. Covariates in the       bivariate analysis with a p-value <0.2 and clinical rationale were included in a       multivariable regression model that was restricted to a subject-to-variable ratio of 10:1.       Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25 (Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.4 (Cary,       NC).

Leveraging our presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett       Clinic, we intend to develop a model that can screen a large number of patients at varying       levels of risk and manifestation of clinical symptoms while conserving personal protective       equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care workers. This will also serve       to support the enterprise and public health response. Towards this goal, we must first assess       the equivalence between clinician-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to patient-collected       tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 across a broad       cross-section of the population.

NCT03852537,2019-12-02,Recruiting,Phase 2,Interventional,Steroid Dosing by bioMARker Guided Titration in Critically Ill Patients With Pneumonia,SMART Trial: Steroid Dosing by bioMARker Guided Titration in Critically Ill Patients With Pneumonia,Pneumonia,Methylprednisolone;Usual Care,All,18,,No,55905,Treatment,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,,Double,"       This is a two-arm single-center pilot phase II clinical trial. Patients will be screened at       the time of hospital admission and will be required to be enrolled within the clinical trial       within 48 hours of hospital admission.       In the individualized, biomarker-concordant arm, all patients will receive steroids once at       the time of admission, then a daily morning dose. In order to account for varying turnaround       time at different laboratories, CRP levels will be drawn with early morning labs, and used to       determine the steroid dosing for the day. Patients will receive daily CRP measurements for       the first 5 days of the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge. CRP measurements will       be discontinued once the CRP is less than 50mmol/L.       Steroid administration will be facilitated using standardized computerized physician order       entry. The patients, treating physicians and outcome assessors will be blinded to the group       assignment. Steroid order sets will include 6 hourly point of care glucose monitoring, and an       insulin sliding scale for glucose levels to facilitate glucose management. The need for       insulin drip will be determined by the treating physician. Additional testing including serum       and urine ketones will be informed by the glucose level, serum anion gap and bicarbonate       levels in routine basic metabolic panels and determined by the treating physician.       In the usual care arm, patients will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of       the hospitalization, or until hospital discharge.     ","       In community acquired pneumonia, corticosteroids have been shown to have potential benefit.       However, the limited and variable use of adjunctive corticosteroids in critically ill       patients is largely due to an inability to identify patients that will benefit from the use       of anti-inflammatory medications. This study compares usual care to a novel       biomarker-tailored steroid dosing algorithm for patients with community acquired pneumonia.       In April 2020, in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, we added a COVID-19 arm to this study.       The study will evaluate the role of biomarker-titrated adjuvant corticosteroid administration       compared to usual care in patients admitted to hospital with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection       and acute respiratory failure.

TAK-981 is being tested to evaluate       safety, tolerability, and PK in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or       relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies and in a subset with COVID-19. The study will       include a dose escalation phase and cancer treatment expansions and COVID-19 expansion.       The study will enroll approximately 140 participants, approximately 50 participants in the       dose escalation phase, approximately 15 participants in each of the 2 cohorts of cancer       treatment expansion phase and approximately 60 participants in the COVID-19 expansion.       In the dose escalation, dose levels will be escalated based on safety, and available PK and       pharmacodynamic data. This study will also determine the single agent recommended phase 2       dose (RP2D). Participants in dose expansion phase will be enrolled, once maximum tolerated       dose (MTD) or biological effective dose (BED) is determined. One of the 2 cohorts in cancer       treatment expansions will consist of participants with relapsed/refractory lymphomas, and       other cohort will consist of participants with solid tumors with no standard therapeutic       option available with established clinical benefit. In the COVID-19 expansion, dose schedule       can be modified in Safety lead-in if PK, pharmacodynamics, decrease in viral load and safety       data are supportive. Once the Safety Lead-in is complete and a TAK-981 dose and regimen is       selected, randomized COVID-19 proof of concept will begin with participants randomized to Arm       A: COVID-19 standard of care (SOC), or Arm B: COVID-19 SOC + TAK-981.       This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time       to participate in this study is approximately 3 years. The overall time to receive treatment       in the dose escalation and cancer treatment is approximately 1 year and in COVID-19       expansion, participants will receive 1 cycle of treatment and will be followed for up to 90       days from enrollment. Based on decision of sponsor, participants with demonstrated clinical       benefit can continue treatment beyond 1 year. Participants will make multiple visits to the       clinic, and will make a final visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of drug or before       the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first for a follow-up       assessment.     ","       The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-981 as       a single agent in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas in dose       escalation and cancer treatment expansions, and to assess change in acute respiratory       syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load within 8 days of TAK-981 administration in       COVID expansion.

NCT01306084,2011-03-05,Enrolling by invitation,,Observational,Viral Infections in Healthy and Immunocompromised Hosts,Viral Infections in Healthy and Immunocompromised Hosts,Herpes Viruses,,All,,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,20892,,,,Cohort,,"       Viral infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients       as well as out-patients. New strains of viruses may appear and cause epidemics in healthy       persons or immunocompromised persons. A better understanding of these new virus strains may       help to control and prevent these infections. Some viral infections that would otherwise be       asymptomatic or cause mild disease can be life threatening in immunocompromised persons.       Immunocompromised persons often shed high titers of virus for prolonged periods of time. In       the absence of a potent immune system, viruses may evolve more rapidly in their hosts.       Therefore, analysis of sequential virus specimens from these patients can provide information       on virus evolution, including how resistance to antiviral agents can develop. In addition,       higher titers of virus may be associated with virus mutants that are more adapted to grow in       cell culture. In this protocol we will obtain specimens containing viruses from otherwise       healthy or immunocompromised patients over sequential periods of time to study their nucleic       acid sequences, sensitivity to antiviral agents, cell types infected by the virus, and       ability to grow in cell culture. In some cases we weill review tissue biosies or clinical       reports from outside laboratories to assist with the diagnosis of virus-associated diseases.       We will also record the patient s signs and symptoms, note results of any pertinent       laboratory work-up, and in some cases, obtain blood to measure immune responses, isolate       antibodies, or virus-specific T cells, or to look for viremia. This study should provide       further understanding on how viruses evolve in their natural hosts, how they become resistant       to antiviral agents, how antibody responses evolve to viruses, and might allow some currently       uncultivatable viruses to be grown in cell culture.     ","       Background:       - Viral infections are an important cause of illness and death in hospitalized patients as       well as outpatients. New strains of viruses may appear and infect both healthy people and       those with weak immune systems. A better understanding of these new virus strains may help to       control and prevent these infections. In particular, some viral infections that are less       problematic in healthy persons can be life threatening in persons with weak immune systems,       and viruses may be able to evolve more rapidly in persons with weak immune systems and       therefore develop resistance to existing treatments. Researchers are interested in collecting       samples and information from otherwise healthy persons or persons with weak immune systems to       study the effects of viruses and their development.       Objectives:       - To collect samples and data from individuals who have been exposed to or have contracted       viral infections.       Eligibility:         -  Individuals of all ages who have been diagnosed with a viral infection are suspected to            have a viral infection, or have been in close contact with someone with a suspected or            actual viral infection that is of interest to investigators in the Laboratory of            Infectious Diseases.         -  Healthy persons and persons with weak immune systems (immunocompromised individuals) are            eligible to participate.       Design:         -  Participants will be initially screened with a review of the medical records and if            eligible a history and physical will be performed.         -  Study procedures may include blood, stool, urine, saliva, or nasal fluid samples, and            throat and genital swabs. For participants who have a specialized sample collection            procedure as part of their medical care (e.g., spinal tap, bronchoscopy, liver biopsy),            researchers may collect leftover samples from the clinical laboratory for testing.         -  Samples may be collected up to four times per week during the first 2 weeks after            enrollment in the study, and then as many as two times per week for up to 1 year. The            number of study visits will be determined by the study researchers, and will depend on            the virus being studied. Some participants may be asked to continue providing samples            for longer than 1 year if there is concern for recurrence or relapse of the infection or            if the study researchers feel that there are other reasons where it would be important            to follow the viral infection.         -  For otherwise healthy persons who have been exposed to a viral infection, an initial            specimen will be collected and then up to three additional specimens may be collected            over 1 year.         -  Treatment will not be offered under this study.
